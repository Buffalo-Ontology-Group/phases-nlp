# Phases Articles Retrieval

This project is a Python application that retrieves articles related to specific topics,"gerotranscendence" and "solitude", downloads their PDFs, and saves them to a local directory. 

## Features

- Retrieves articles from PubMed.
    - The number of articles retrieved for each topic can be customized by adjusting the 'max_results' parameter. It can be modified to retrieve a higher or lower number of articles.
- Searches for available PDF links (via PubMed Central, Google, and Google Scholar).
- Downloads and saves PDFs to a user-defined directory.

## Configuration

The number of articles retrieved for each keyword can be adjusted by modifying the script. Currently, it retrieves a fixed number of articles, but this can be customized by adjusting the `max_results` parameter to customize the number of articles retrieved.
