# Phases Articles Retrieval

This project is a Python application that retrieves articles related to specific topics,"gerotranscendence" and "solitude", downloads their PDFs, and saves them to a local directory. 

## Features

- Retrieves articles from PubMed.
    - The number of articles retrieved for each topic can be customized by adjusting the 'max_results' parameter. It can be modified to retrieve a higher or lower number of articles.
- Searches for available PDF links (via PubMed Central, Google, and Google Scholar).
- Downloads and saves PDFs to a user-defined directory.

## Configuration

The number of articles to be downloaded for each keyword is prompted at the command line. When running the script, the user will be asked to enter the desired number of articles which can be customized interactively.
