# Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF_IDF) computation on research abstracts of related to the PHASES project

This project computes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores for a collection of research abstracts, related to specific topics such as gerotranscendence and solitude. It processes abstracts stored in an Excel file, computes the TF-IDF scores across all terms, and outputs the most significant terms based on their average TF-IDF scores. 

## Features

- Preprocesses abstracts
- Computes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scores for each term in the collection of abstracts.
- Identifies the most significant terms: Sorts terms by their average TF-IDF score to identify the most important words across the entire corpus.
- Allows the user to specify the number of top terms (by TF-IDF score) to display in the results (default is 10).
- Saves the top TF-IDF terms to a text file in a user specified directory.

    
## Configuration

The number of terms to be  to be retrieved is prompted at the command line. When running the script, the user will be asked to enter the desired number of terms, which can be customized interactively.
