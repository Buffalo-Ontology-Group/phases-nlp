BERTopic results default gerotranscendence

Topic 0 (Gerontology): theories, gerontology, theoretical, gerontological, departure, points, research, paradigm, overflow, within
Summary: Theory of gerotranscendence was developed from unsatisfying mismatch of common theoretical assumptions within social gerontology and some empirical findings. We will argue that the usual theoretical points of departure for gerontological research only represent a narrow corridor in a theoretical field, which is much broader.

Topic 1 (Nursing): staff, nurses, percent, areas, impact, members, recipients, homes, theory, service
Summary: Familiarity with the Theory Seemed to Reduce Feelings of Insufficiency at Work. Theory Helped Many Staff Members to See Care Recipients in a New Light and to Understand Them Better.

Topic 2 (Dissatisfaction): disengagement, theory, cumming, individual, hypothesis, disengage, was, paradigmatic, 1968, supposed
Summary: Cumming, Newell, Dean, & McCaf- frey (1960) first pub- lished their tentative disengagement theory of aging. The theory assumed an intrinsic tendency to disengage and withdraw when growing old.

Topic 3 (Gerotranscendence): gerotranscendence, practice, towards, acceler, tenth, gerotranscendence3, ated, shortcuts, obstructing, obstructions
Summary: Gerotranscendence can be facilitated or obstructed in different ways. The process of gerotrans transcendence can, according to the theory, be acceler- ated, facilitated or Obstructed.

Topic 4 (Depression): interviewees, sign, isolation, elderly, pleasure, parties, interpreted, statements, people, loneliness
Summary: A lack of interest in participating in parties can be understood as a symptom of a beginning dementia (the pathology perspective) or as a way to cope with reduced mobility by means of selecting where and how often to go to parties (the SOC perspective) Robinson, 1976; Bradford, 1979; Bernard, 1982. Other indications came from subjective reports of staff members working with old people.

Topic 5 (Cosmic): women, men, cosmic, score, category, age, transcendence, difference, 75, drop
Summary: Women score higher than men on cosmic transcendence, but that this difference decreases with increasing age. The women’s higher levels of cosmic transcen- dence, especially in the age interval 25–44, might be partly connected with childbirth.

Topic 6 (Solitude): solitude, need, positive, respected, increased, now, for, link, evident, become
Summary: The modern asceticism described above contains a prominent element of what we call positive solitude. The need for and the pleasure of contemplative positive solitude is highly evident in our interviews.

Topic 7 (Retirement): retirement, retired, longitudinal, 1971, atchley, attitudes, identity, townsend, ment, streib
Summary: Early conceptions about possible retirement adaptation, developed while the retirement role was still gaining popular acceptance, foresaw retire- ment as a stressful transition and a “crisis” for personal identity. Research reports from longitudinal studies of workers’ experience before and after retirement concluded that there is likely to be continuity of well-being and activities over the transition.

Topic 8 (Gerotranscendence): social, gerotranscendence, understood, wise, shame, pilot, archetype, nullifying, ere, redefini
Summary: Theory of gerotranscendence is not formulated with the aim of nullifying other theories within social Theories of social disengagement can be understood as changes in point of view, shifts of emphasis and redefini- tions of the meaning of social relations.

Topic 9 (Organize): organize, activities, alone, talk, do, arranged, much, parties, room, sit
Summary: I go to an older woman that I know, sit and talk to her. I get much more out of this than going to parties and being with a lot of people where you really don’t talk so much with people.

Topic 10 (Reminiscence): function, reminiscence, unity, existence, identity, purposes, category, conversation, age, 34
Summary: Figure 4.15 also shows that the conversation function of reminiscence is more or less the same up to the age category 45–54, after which it starts a moderate increase. Regarding the unity of existence function, the age slopes for men and women parallel each other, with women being constantly higher.

Topic 11 (Cosmic): crises, 12, women, cosmic, transcendence, experienced, men, power, who, degree
Summary: Crises contribute positively to the development of cosmic transcendence for both men and women. In old age, crises seem to lose their impact in this respect.

Topic 12 (Widowhood): crises, crisis, load, disease, schedule, age, subjectively, connection, groups, types
Summary: The proportion of respondents who had experienced a crisis in life in connection with another person’s disease did not increase with age. There is no statistically significant correlation between this type of crisis and age.

Topic 13 (Staff): breaking, members, interpretations, hand, references, landings, introducing, staff, guidelines, bounds
Summary: Some staff members gave interpretations related to assumptions about depression and defense mechanisms. What Do These Studies on Staff Members’ Interpretations Reveal?

Topic 14 (Theory): link, stick, above, theory, unanswered, religious, origin, natural, some, specifically
Summary: The impact survey produced the results discussed below. Some people stick with a natural science theory and others with a religious theory.

Topic 15 (Conclusions): conclusions, conclusion, confusion, ahead, along, lines, summary, far, step, further
Summary: In conclusion: Confusion. Another respondent said, along similar lines

Topic 16 (Rejoicing): universe, feeling, rejoicing, nature, tendency, materializes, subtle, grand, cosmos, feelings
Summary: Rejoicing. often a feeling of cosmic communion with the spirit of the universe, and a redefinition of time, space, life, and death.

Topic 17 (Gerotranscendence): factors, incident, matrix, age, scale, correlate, depression, coherence, study, impact
Summary: The degree of gerotranscendence is expected to increase with age. In this study, however, neither cosmic transcendence nor ego-transcendence show any correlation with the age of the respondent.

Topic 18 (Childhood): childhood, talk, about, interviewees, interviewed, ask, events, willing, dream, willingness
Summary: 50 people who volunteered, between 52 and 97 years of age, were interviewed some months later. Interviewees noted that the elderly tend to talk about their childhood.

Topic 19 (155): 196, 187, 155, 121, 48, 31, 78, focusing, 65, the
Summary: 65+ 121 155

Topic 20 (Crises): diseases, additive, mark, respondents, asked, crises, experienced, number, index, simple
Summary: Survey asked respondents whether they had experienced specific listed problems in coping during the last 12 months. One of the gerotranscendence measures is related to the degree to which the respondents have a positive view of the possibili- ties of solving problems connected with the specific trauma of losing a close person.

Topic 21 (Gerotranscendence): process, toward, midlife, old, mid, everyone, successful, culture, gerotranscendence, western
Summary: Author: We sometimes erroneously project midlife values, activity patterns, and expectations onto old age. We suggest that growing into old age has its very own meaning and character.

Topic 22 (Gerotranscendence): yet, gerotranscendence, methodology, cautiously, developmental, age, watering, differences, 74, proper
Summary: The term gerotranscendence has been chosen because many of the related changes, crises, or developmental characteristics described by oth- ers involve various ways in which elderly people break through old bound- aries. In today’s society, we probably lack much of the proper watering, which also means that the proportion of individuals who reach high degrees of gerotrancendence is quite small.

Topic 23 (Gerontological): urbanization, generations, industrialization, good, society, conditions, hareven, effects, contact, ingenious
Summary: A˚ kerman’s expectations about the elderly are derived from a well-established theoretical background. The theoretical background in question focuses on the supposed conditions in the old peasant society.

Topic 24 (Transcendence): activity, satisfaction, degree, social, transcendence, between, higher, correlation, essential, cosmic
Summary: The higher the degree of cosmic transcendence, the weaker is the correlation between social activity and life satisfaction. The more transcendent the respondent, the less essential is social activity for life satisfaction, according to the study.

Topic 25 (Postulate): system, earth, sun, space, picture, time, paradigm, orbit, planets, copernicus
Summary: When Copernicus suggested that the Earth and the other planets were in orbit around the sun, his hypothesis was nothing less than a revolutionary shift of paradigm. Not only the picture of the cosmic system but all scientific theories were changed by this shift.

Topic 26 (Meetings): intervention, nursing, wards, home, staff, residents, guidelines, environment, trivial, municipality
Summary: 100 nurses reported understanding of the theory and cases which fit the theory more frequently. Staff working in nursing homes reported less impact and applicability of the intervention.

Topic 27 (Impact): impact, probability, calculations, survey, intervention, index, coefficients, 03, data, participants
Summary: Six months after group discussions, a mail survey consisting of an impact measurement was sent to the participants. 73 percent of the participants reported that they, to a “certain” or “high” degree, understood the point of the theory.

Topic 28 (Gerotranscendence): erikson, ego, stage, integration, integrity, eighth, model, process, reaches, goes
Summary: The idea of a life process which optimally ends with gerotranscen- dence recalls the developmental model formulated by Erik H. Erikson (1950, 1982) According to this model the individual develops through seven stages and, if all goes well, ends up in an eighth stage.

Topic 29 (Pathology): quantitative, questions, lucid, whenever, track, explana, brief, rely, questioning, outset
Summary: Some of the questions that will be addressed below rely on more than one of the above studies. The study intended to give answers to the following questions: In particular we shall focus on the following topics: recognized behaviors and empirical findings.

Topic 30 (Gerotranscendental): behaviors, staff, gerotranscendental, nursing, signs, house, members, pathology, interpret, behavior
Summary: The theory of gerotranscendence identifies a number of “signs’ of gero- transcendence. These signs include changes in the definitions of time and space, body-transcendence, ego-integrity, and emancipated innocence.

Topic 31 (Reminiscence): variables, reminiscence, independent, explanatory, cosmic, power, transcendence, dimensions, 16, table
Summary: The unity and identity reminiscence functions are the two variables that, together with pure age, are able to predict cosmic transcendence better than others. Each one of these two variables has a substantial positive explanatory power even when other variables are controlled for.

Topic 32 (Wisdom): right, wrong, everyday, advice, wisdom, giving, unwise, accompanied, tolerance, decisions
Summary: Everyday wisdom is expressed by avoiding both giving good advice and helping people make decisions. The origin of this form of everyday wisdom is the transcendence of the boundary between right and wrong accompanied by an increased broadmindedness and tolerance.

Topic 33 (Loneliness): loneliness, solitude, losses, need, interaction, decreased, consecutive, kind, positive, strength
Summary: The Swedish language lacks a cognate of the primarily positive English word solitude. This may be a further reason why the positive need for solitude may be misinterpreted in terms of negative disengagement, depression, apathy or resignation.

Topic 34 (Immortality): immortality, eva, she, genetic, her, mysticism, circular, coiling, faith, chain
Summary: Eva has transcended the boundary that we normally draw between past, present, and future. She also has strong links with her ancestors, “because I [literally] live very much in the time of my ancestors’ generations, too”

Topic 35 (Music): music, experiences, block, breaking, drama, man, down, barrier, become, 77
Summary: In the section on sources of happiness, a 77-year-old man related how experiences of music had become more important and more emotional for him. The man himself said that it was a barrier that had been broken down.

Topic 36 (Crises): difference, among, men, women, married, table, gender, years, two, percent
Summary: Table 4.10 shows the proportions of respondents in specified age and gender categories who have experienced various types of life crises during the last two years. The proportion of respondents who had experienced a crisis in life in connection with their own disease increases with age for both men and women.

Topic 37 (Gerotranscendence): outline, self, generated, suggest, borders, permeable, qualitative, open, themes, theme
Summary: Aging implies a process during which the degree of transcendence increases from young adulthood and on. The condition of gerotranscendence is reached by a process where all the experiences in earlier life are included.

Topic 38 (Eva): she, eva, herself, her, circle, has, abandoned, friends, become, big
Summary: Eva, formerly a nurse, was 69 years old at the time of the interview. She had a difficult childhood; her upbring- ing was strict and brutal.

Topic 39 (Reminiscence): reminiscence, functions, reconstructions, related, gerotranscendence, gerotranscendental, gero, empirically, might, cause
Summary: Reminiscence might be part of the gerotranscendental change, and might therefore play an instrumen- tal role in this process. In the case of cosmic transcendence, this implies a change in the very way in which we understand our whole being.

Topic 40 (Self): confrontation, self, discovery, occurs, altruism, theme, wishes, hidden, needs, bad
Summary: Reactions to the self-confrontation theme illustrate, among other things, that people have come to see certain egotistical features in them- selves. This type of change has been called self-transcendence by Chinen (1989b) The wishes and needs of the self are transcended in favor of other people’s needs and wishes.

Topic 41 (Gradual): button, est, sewing, accordingly, adaptations, assuming, nature, 58, gradual, money
Summary: Several respondents recognized this and many pointed out that it had been a gradual change during life. Instead of assuming that such changes are adaptations to decreasing possibilities in life, one must accordingly ask whether the increasing inter- est in the small everyday experiences of nature does not have a deeper significance.

Topic 42 (Elderly): discovered, altruistic, few, tolerance, answer, respondent, self, was, personality, acceptance
Summary: The elderly are more tolerant and accepting of other people’s views, according to a survey of elderly people. The survey also asked respondents if they had discovered previously unknown personal characteristics.

Topic 43 (Crises): accelerate, contain, crises, development, objective, kinetic, transfigure, originally, rediscover, briefly
Summary: Life crises may contain the kinetic energy that make the development towards gerotranscendence accelerate. Our interviews contain several examples in which crises have contrib- uted to an accelerated development.

Topic 44 (Gerotranscendence): coping, offensive, defensive, copers, low, high, degrees, percent, patterns, multicopers
Summary: If gerotranscendence were the same as disengagement, we would predict a passive or defen- sive coping style. Instead we find a pattern where high degrees of gerotrancendence are combined with more coping, more offensive coping, and more multicoping.

Topic 45 (Gerotranscendence): satisfaction, longitudinal, 1990, measured, life, gerotranscendence, causal, 1986, degree, unconditionally
Summary: People who do not reach gerotranscendence are expected to score lower on life satisfaction. Individuals with a high degree of gerotrancen- dence have a higher degree of life satisfaction, study finds.

Topic 46 (Cosmic): trend, lines, correlation, cosmic, having, figure, 12, transcendence, converge, illuminated
Summary: Figures 4.11 and 4.12 show a positive correlation between age and cosmic transcendence. No such relationship was found with ego-transcendence.

Topic 47 (Reminiscence): induced, illness, crisis, cosmic, crises, higher, dimension, transcendence, data, affected
Summary: Having experienced a crisis in life is, according to our analysis, con- nected with higher degrees of cosmic transcendence, but lower degrees of coherence. The previous 1990 Danish retrospective study showed that individuals who, during the year previous to the survey, experienced the death of a person close to them had higher values on the cosmic gerotranscendence dimension.

Topic 48 (Solitude): solitude, need, increase, civil, age, 65, divergent, 35, 44, disregarding
Summary: Figure 4.3 shows in more detail what the general age-solitude pattern looks like among men and women. The need for solitude increases up to the age category of 35–44 and remains quite stable after that.

Topic 49 (Adopters): members, staff, guidelines, adopters, early, discussions, laggards, skeptical, 2003b, group
Summary: Wadensten and Carlsson (2002) looked at how staff adopted guidelines based on the theory of gerotranscendence. They found that certain staff members more easily adopted the new approach.

Topic 50 (Guilt): guilt, feelings, insufficiency, work, satisfied, tasks, homes, staff, colleagues, reported
Summary: Staff members were asked whether they liked their work tasks, place of work, and colleagues, and if they had feelings of guilt or insufficiency at work. Overall, the staff were quite satisfied with both their tasks and their places of work and colleagues.

Topic 51 (Transcendence): permissiveness, listening, nonexistent, stimuli, topics, increased, staff, new, 33, introduction
Summary: A Third of the Staff Members Became More Permissive and Better Listeners. Registered nurses reported most fre- quently that they had come to understand one or several care recipients in a new light.

Topic 52 (Solitude): seekers, solitude, diseases, percent, need, proportion, report, are, category, slightly
Summary: With advanced age comes an increased need for soli- tude. Widowed, unmarried, or divorced are slightly more solitude-seeking than are the married/cohabiting ones.

Topic 53 (Residents): routinely, do, correct, always, conversation, incor, rect, try, signs, not
Summary: Do not regard signs of gerotranscendence as undesirable and incor- rect. Do choose a topic of conversation not focusing on health and physical limitations.

Topic 54 (Zen): zen, buddhist, world, buddhism, probably, paradigm, thinking, disengaged, western, buddhists
Summary: We are going to contrast our understanding of the world with what a Zen Buddhist would probably have. The Zen Buddhist probably lives within a cosmic world paradigm where many boundaries are diffuse and permeable.

Topic 55 (Meditation): jung, collective, unconscious, meditation, tasks, lecture, half, structures, acquainted, pathway
Summary: C. G.

Topic 56 (Scientific): scientific, society, presuppositions, science, anarchistic, overflow, basic, surrounding, concepts, choose
Summary: In the contemporary sociology of knowledge there is evidence that science is not as “scientific” as was once believed. Much of the very substance of science is nothing but “common sense,” which, imported from the surrounding society, becomes an integral part of recognized scientific practice.

Topic 57 (Elderly): research, making, gerontological, sociopolitical, elderly, responsible, improvements, researchers, upon, arguments
Summary: For more than 30 years I have been interested in how people adapt to the changes associated with aging. Juul-Jensen (1984) once wrote about gerontological researchers in this respect.

Topic 58 (Transcended): chain, generations, grandchildren, attachment, link, connection, stream, ensues, children, earlier
Summary: “The coiling genetic chain” is present in the children and the grandchildren. This chain provides the opportunity to participate in life on earth in the future.

Topic 59 (Oneself): centeredness, confidence, self, decrease, feels, eventuate, removal, struggling, establish, esteem
Summary: Many respondents mentioned that the new capacity to “be oneself” is related to an increased self-confidence. “It feels like I don’t need to take on any role because I’m confident in myself,” said a 69-year-old woman.

Topic 60 (Midlife): masquerade, options, lifestyle, identity, midlife, strategy, urge, maintain, keeping, into
Summary: The continuity perspective assumes a positive and natural urge to continue the midlife lifestyle and identity into old age. The masquerade perspective, where a masquerade in old age becomes part of a coping strategy to maintain identity as a means of keeping one’s options open.

Topic 61 (Retirement): retirement, health, physical, negative, traumatic, declining, aspects, consequences, effects, retire
Summary: Many gerontologists have put forward the hypothesis of the negative effects of retirement, in regard to both psychological well-being and physical health. But epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated that the event of retirement does not influence the risk of decline in physical or mental health.

Topic 62 (Scales): function, dimension, includes, condensed, statements, chosen, refer, unity, reminiscence, conversation
Summary: We have constructed a condensed, three-dimensional reminiscence functions scale. Our factor analysis produced three dimensions that we have named unity of existence function, identity function and conversation function.

Topic 63 (Statistically): safe, draw, 1995, sectional, swedish, cross, study, combining, following, statistically
Summary: The main purpose of the Swedish 1995 cross-Sectional Study was to address the following question: Would it be possible, in a study including age and gender, to combine the two studies at the same time? Among the predictor variables, the study showed correlations between the need for.

Topic 64 (Childhood): childhood, periods, events, you, your, back, go, reconciling, reinterpret, return
Summary: Time and childhood. Changes in the definitions of time and the return of childhood.

Topic 65 (Transcendence): transcenders, chaid, nontranscenders, value, identified, index, group, variables, subgroup, set
Summary: On a five-point scale of cosmic transcendence, 31 percent of the oldest respondents (75–85) have the highest value. Men, between 20 and 44 years of age, who have not experienced any crisis during the two years previous to the study, are the least likely to have experienced cosmic transcendences.

Topic 66 (Social): contacts, contact, grandchildren, visits, home, children, outside, social, relationships, cleaning
Summary: Social activity was measured by an additive index summing up the frequency of visits to other people in their homes. The reason for excluding contacts with children and grandchildren from this index was that only those social activities where the older people themselves had more of a choice in initiating contact were to be included.

Topic 67 (Coherence): category, statistically, significant, men, coherence, women, age, 65, difference, 35
Summary: In Figure 4.2 the degree of coherence is shown in relation to age and gender. For women, the increase is more or less continuous.

Topic 68 (Elderly): science, order, effort, central, final, research, functionalism, coleman, categorizing, reality
Summary: Sociology of science has taught us that science in general and social gerontology, never is absolute or final. Scientific theories can be understood as special ways of categorizing and systematizing reality to make it understandable and to create order in life.

Topic 69 (Emancipated): innocence, emancipated, conventions, capacity, maturity, needless, enhances, prestige, transcend, associated
Summary: A new kind of innocence and spontaneity is added to adult judgment and rationality. This allows important feelings and ques- tions to be expressed regardless of the barriers of social conventions.

Topic 70 (Gerotranscendence): syndrome, breakdown, disengagement, withdrawal, traditional, social, concept, part, may, paradoxically
Summary: One hypothesis is that, paradoxically, obstruction of the gerotrans- cendental process may possibly precipitate a real syndrome of social break- down. Hindered in their own personal development, and assaulted by feelings of guilt, individuals may regress to a former developmental stage.

Topic 71 (Gerotranscendence): aging, testimonies, pair, approaches, makes, given, retired, gerontology, machine, ekerdt
Summary: Knowing about the theory of gerotranscendence can then be like the coin that makes the slot machine work, or like the new pair of eyeglasses that make you see the world in a new way. One of the “behaviors” described in the theory is transcendence of the time borders between past and present.

Topic 72 (Gerotranscendental): exercises, catalysts, obstacles, described, development, gerotranscendental, personal, content, your, devise
Summary: According to the theory, the development towards gerotranscen- dence can be obstructed as well as facilitated. These catalysts and obstacles are described in the following.

Topic 73 (Fear): death, fear, learn, disappears, comprehension, lot, crease, would, so, there
Summary: The fear of death disappears and a new comprehension of life and death results. Life and death.

Topic 74 (Transcendence): transcend, sense, didactic, inflated, fairytales, metaphysical, afore, self, motif, establish
Summary: For the people we interviewed, there has hardly been any inflated self-importance to transcend. Rather, it has been a question of struggling to establish a level of confidence that feels appropriate.

Topic 75 (Crises): challenge, crises, ontological, defined, replacing, foundations, undermines, upheavals, won, undermine
Summary: Peck: I don't think a person should ask for crises, but I think that we learn something from the crises we go through. According to Peck, the following crises occur in the second half of life:

Topic 76 (Solitude): superficial, selective, relations, importance, prefers, becomes, exhibiting, relationships, character, interested
Summary: According to the theory of gerotranscendence, the individual redefines the importance of social relationships in such a way that he/she becomes more selective. All of the interviewees in our study confirmed that they have noticed a decreased need for social interaction and an increased need for solitude in their patients.

Topic 77 (Reminiscence): reminiscence, reconstruction, continuity, change, function, contribute, focused, stabilization, quantify, seldom
Summary: The success of reminiscence might not always be related to continuity, but instead to just the opposite. It might sometimes contribute to the change and reconstruction not only of the identity, but also of the very way in which we understand reality.

Topic 78 (Gerotranscendence): staff, care, recipients, theory, did, help, specific, evaluation, gerotran, venture
Summary: This section describes an attempt to introduce the theory of gerotran- scendence to nursing staff. The venture included two steps: 1) the intro- duction of the theory, and 2) six months later, an impact evaluation.

Topic 79 (Reminiscence): reminiscence, history, therapy, stabilize, 1998, occurrence, parker, talking, successful, times
Summary: There is an ongoing debate as to whether or not reminiscence has anything to do with aging (Cohen & Taylor, 1998). As suggested by Webster (1995), the occurrence of reminiscoence might be determined by gender and per- sonality rather than by age.

Topic 80 (Gerotranscendence): psychotropics, consumption, mental, depression, illness, psychopharmacological, critics, drugs, use, symptoms
Summary: The state of gerotranscendence is negatively correlated with depression, mental disturbances, and consumption of psychotropics. The only statistically significant correlation in this respect is the negative correlation between the use of psychopharmacological drugs26 and the gerotscendence scales.

Topic 81 (Guidelines): guidelines, care, focus, older, nursing, groups, practical, carlsson, wadensten, 2002
Summary: Wadensten and Carlsson (2002) derived theory-driven guidelines for the practical care of older people based on the theory of gerotranscendence. With the help of focus groups they have arrived at a series of guidelines focusing on three levels: 1) what the individual staff member can do in meetings with the care recipient, 2) new types of activities to arrange, and 3) measures on the organizational level.

Topic 82 (Swedish): survey, 104, mailed, swedish, mail, questions, 65, sample, 2001, collections
Summary: The Swedish 2001 (65+) Study was a mail survey of 1771 Swedish men and women. The total number of respon- dents was 1,771, the oldest respondent being 104 years.

Topic 83 (Values): independence, productivity, effectiveness, contempt, value, ourselves, middle, unproductive, ineffective, emphasis
Summary: White, Western, middle-class, middle life society has been characterized by an overwhelmingly strong performance orien- tation. In Western society we strongly value productivity, effectiveness and independence.

Topic 84 (Scientists): chinen, scientists, lysenko, 1989a, scientific, their, analyzed, north, name, alfred
Summary: Chinen (1989a) holds that this development is seen in individuals who either are given the chance or have within them the power to develop freely. Many of us, however, meet obstacles to such a free development.

Topic 85 (Aging): sorry, misery, responsibility, elderly, contempt, feeble, perceive, programs, ideal, feel
Summary: Ofstad: We have a need to perceive the elderly as feeble and weak, in order for us to feel sorry for them. The myths have the function of solving the problem of our contempt for weak- ness in the elderly.

Topic 86 (Touch): themselves, me, chain, you, try, energy, genetic, longer, flow, closer
Summary: Some people say that they have changed their view of themselves during life in such a way that they no longer see themselves as being as important as before. Try to imagine that your individuality is part of something larger.

Topic 87 (Normality): normality, strain, psychotropic, medications, bodily, psychological, involvement, normal, mental, quantitative
Summary: In the Wadensten and Carlsson (2001) study body transcendence, when it was observed, was categorized among the signs of gerotranscen- dence described as “normal” by the interviewed staff members. The old people were said to have adapted to their bodily changes and accepted the fact that one changes.

Topic 88 (Change): they, weren, went, accept, things, perfect, depressed, meager, through, happened
Summary: "They think life has been really good. They even seem to accept the things that weren’t good, they don't need everything to be so perfect" "Their lives are often so meager that any type of change is perceived as positive" "They accept what’s

Topic 89 (Times): trip, theater, porch, excited, kitchen, dinner, visit, sit, happen, things
Summary: Earlier it may have been things like a visit to the theater, a dinner, a trip. I wanted certain things to happen that I was a little excited about.

Topic 90 (Roles): roles, role, playing, necessity, comforting, takes, abandon, urge, play, difference
Summary: An understanding of the difference between self and role takes place, sometimes with an urge to abandon roles. Roles are necessary for life to function, and can be played easily even when they are not “genuine”

Topic 91 (Gerotranscendence): predictors, probable, measure, regards, present, conclude, coherence, satisfaction, even, controlled
Summary: The activity measure has a substantial and remaining correlation with coherence. This correlation is, with some small variations, found for all age groups from 65 to 95+.

Topic 92 (Solitude): satisfaction, predictors, weak, swept, unrelated, correlation, se, solitude, need, significant
Summary: In the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study, the need for solitude correlated negatively with life satisfaction. This correlation was statistically significant but rather weak.

Topic 93 (Gerotranscendence): core, three, swedish, 2002, sectional, cross, empirically, cosmic, dimensions, 103
Summary: The dimensions of gerotranscendence were described as ontological changes in: the cosmic, b) the self, c) social and individual relationships. In the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study of 2002 Swedish men and women, the three dimensions were approximated with three measures: cosmic transcendence, coherence, and need.

Topic 94 (Satisfaction): item, single, five, overall, scale, indices, satisfied, fixed, point, rate
Summary: Life satisfaction was measured by a single item, where the respondent, using a five-point scale stated how satisfied or dissatisfied he or she was with overall life at present. An old age depression scale was constructed on the basis of five items.

Topic 95 (Fear): death, fear, feared, generation, christian, succeeding, youth, usual, matters, obviously
Summary: Some people experience changes during life in relation to the questions of life and death. Somebody who has feared death in his or her youth can get rid of the fear later in life.

Topic 96 (Transcendence): body, taking, obsessed, continues, attuned, thwarted, bodies, hub, noting, obsession
Summary: Some people become increas- ingly preoccupied with their bodies in the second half of life. Others seem to transcend the body in the sense that they know all about their physical condition.

Topic 97 (Greta): greta, her, attaining, eva, she, told, despair, just, kivnick, compounded
Summary: Like Eva, Greta has gone through difficulties in her life, but she does not seem to have been able to turn them into something positive. Answering the open question about whether she may have changed her attitude towards life and herself, she just told about how meaningless life became after she retired.

Topic 98 (Integrity): jigsaw, delicate, integrity, tranquility, puzzle, pieces, demanding, realizes, wholeness, ego
Summary: The individual realizes that the pieces of life’s jigsaw puzzle form a wholeness. This may be a delicate state, demanding tranquility

Topic 99 (Decisions): easier, decisions, advice, wise, make, good, guess, give, think, giving
Summary: Eva Longoria says it's easier to make dumb and wise decisions than to give good advice. Longoria: What I think is wise for me can be very unwise for others.

Topic 100 (Mystery): mystery, accepted, mysteries, incomprehensible, left, life, intro, duced, explained, things
Summary: Some people say that they have come to accept that there are things in life that can not be explained with science or reason. Do you recognize this?

Topic 101 (Kinship): kinship, ancestors, feeling, yes, year, hood, nent, tangible, wakening, promi
Summary: Some people say that, during the course of life, they experienced a change in how they feel in relation to their ancestors. This theme provoked many reactions in the respondents.

Topic 102 (Gerotranscendence): defense, factors, mechanisms, metaworld, process, accelerated, shift, individuals, framework, such
Summary: Gerotranscendence implies a transcendental shift in metaper- spective. This shift seems to be gradual, starting in early adulthood and normally reaching its peak in old age.

Topic 103 (Raised): jante, law, raised, navia, denial, realizing, sandemose, scandi, indoctrination, theses
Summary: A. Sandemose, Danish-Norwegian writer.

Topic 104 (Disease): aren, until, hearing, genes, eyes, born, caused, it, bad, disease
Summary: "I think you’re born with it, being positive and such until you get old. It’s in the genes.

Topic 105 (Cosmic): dimension, cosmic, gerotranscendence, the, of, , , , , 
Summary: The Cosmic Dimension is the

Topic 106 (Cohabiting): cohabiting, marital, split, gender, factors, status, matrix, men, cohabit, produce
Summary: The gender split disappears when we compare men and women who are not cohabiting. The final drop among men was, in the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study, found particularly among cohabit- ing men.

Topic 107 (Masks): betraying, masks, mask, inner, distance, real, think, assumes, aging, anyone
Summary: The Mask of Aging perspective (Featherstone & Hepworth, 1991), which, according to common interpretations, assumes an increasing distance between the real inner self and the betraying aging body. I don’t think that older people need to wear masks.

Topic 108 (95): drop, interrupted, product, error, divergence, speculate, temporary, finding, men, consider
Summary: There is, for both men and women, an increase in coherence with age, beginning already in early adulthood. For men this increase seems to be interrupted by a temporary drop in the age category 35–44.

Topic 109 (Coherence): strong, correla, measure, coherence, found, involving, satisfaction60, conceptually, roughly, correlation
Summary: The coherence in life measure is part of the major “self’ dimension and corresponds roughly to Erikson’s (1950, 1982) “ego integrity” stage in his developmental model. Respondents who score high on this measure report strong feelings of coherence and meaning in life.

Topic 110 (Reminiscence): identity, reminiscence, reconstruction, functions, ontological, stabilize, maturity, world, lived, process
Summary: Theory of gerotranscendence suggests a developmental process including ontological changes in the comprehension of the world and the self. Could it perhaps sometimes play an instru- mental role in a developmental change and reconstruction of not only the identity but also the way we distinguish reality?

Topic 111 (Gerotranscendence): statements, agreed, statement, each, dimensions, previous, framed, respondent, series, qualitative
Summary: Drawing on the previous qualitative and quantitative studies, a series of questions and statements were framed in accordance with the previously described dimensions of gerotranscendence. Statements were worded so as to elicit a snapshot status of these dimensions.

Topic 112 (Eva): her, infatuation, sources, changed, joy, she, watching, self, complete, happy
Summary: Eva describes how she has come to change much of the understanding of herself and her life. She has discovered some self-infatuation with her younger self, at the same time as her sources of joy have changed.

Topic 113 (Mental): re, mentally, physiotherapist, senile, balls, ridiculous, demented, smallest, they, kids
Summary: It depends on their physical age. More of them have become senile and demented with age.

Topic 114 (Wisdom): wisdom, everyday, condemning, broadminded, job, confidence, transpersonal, revised, intrapersonal, represented
Summary: According to the theory of gerotranscendence, having everyday wisdom may be part of a gerotrancendental development. Everyday wisdom was defined as the tendency to be broadminded as opposed to condemning in one’s attitudes.

Topic 115 (Age): die, they, think, like, tomorrow, definitely, pain, anyway, ll, somehow
Summary: When they reach a difficult period of serious illness and pain they can’t manage, then they definitely think about death. When I go to them, they seem like they want to die because they know that’s what will happen anyway.

Topic 116 (Interpretations): interpretations, behaviors, meanings, oriented, negative, reference, tive, additional, positive, continuity
Summary: In some statements, elderly people’s de- creased interest in material things is described in terms of priorities. This was interpreted as a result of aging, i.e., from a developmental perspec- tive.

Topic 117 (Gerotranscendence): mail, metaworld, step, process, supplements, transforming, affiliation, scribe, survey, swedish
Summary: Theoretically, the results from the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study suggest, in line with the previous studies, that there is a process of gerotranscendence, but also that this process may appear different depending on cohort affiliation, gender, and life circumstances. It is not clear whether an individual is demonstrating a negative withdrawal within the mid-life metaworld.

Topic 118 (Body): body, proposed, transcen, accordance, dence, notable, link, none, development, theory
Summary: It is notable that none of the staff members interpreted body transcen- dence from a developmental perspective. This is in accordance with the development of body

Topic 119 (Book): peck, he, choices, process, him, behind, good, supremely, operation, deteriorating
Summary: Peck’s description of how these subjects deal with aging implies a right or good way. In line with Erikson (1950) he pointed to a number of developmental crises that may result in either a positive constructive outcome or a negative one.

Topic 120 (Gerotranscendence): items, disengagement, believed, gagement, disen, implies, explore, untried, dualism, illumina
Summary: Gerotranscendence does not imply any state of withdrawal or disengagement, as is sometimes erroneously believed. It is not the old disengagement theory in a new disguise, as believed by some critics (e.g., Biggs, Hendricks, & Lowenstein, 2003) This book will explore this developmental pattern.

Topic 121 (Assets): material, assets, things, saving, stagnating, volatility, expert, pacifying, growth, 1989b
Summary: The path to wisdom is easier when material needs are transcended. Many show a tendency to try and reduce the number of “things” they own.

Topic 122 (Factors): factor, analyzed, table, produced, analysis, dimensions, data, analysis46, pal, loadings
Summary: Results of the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study are compared with the analysis on the present data. The 2001 (65+) data reproduce the very same dimensions as in 1995, with similar, but not identical, factor loadings.

Topic 123 (Solitude): solitude, dimension, positive, dislike, predominantly, negative, filled, meeting, 42, 41
Summary: The less the satisfaction with life, the higher the need for solitude. The solitude dimension also correlates negatively with the coherence dimen- sion.

Topic 124 (Sectional): sectional, cross, findings, discussion, pointers, proceed, conclu, design, temporally, built
Summary: The data on which we have built these conclu- sions are limited in several ways, culturally, temporally, and, equally important, the fact that they are retrospective and cross-sectional, not longitudinal. Any difference between age categories could, in theory at least, be an unknown mix of cohort effects

Topic 125 (Transcenders): 1990, previous, study, satisfac, danish, reappear, correlation, 1995, later, sectional
Summary: We assumed that individuals with higher degrees of gerotranscendence would score higher on life satisfaction. That was in fact demonstrated in the previous 1990 Danish retrospective study.

Topic 126 (Elderly): elderly, seminar, initiatives, givers, resources, discussed, different, offered, utilized, march
Summary: Gerotranscendence describes something that is, at least for some people, a positive development. Care givers need more theoretical knowledge about alternative frames of reference.

Topic 127 (Stockings): stockings, tails, tuxedo, torn, wearing, play, around, dinners, required, nowadays
Summary: I have been much too domineering  I kind of forced myself on them As long as I was working I had to go to different things. Tails were required at some dinners, at others a tuxedo.

Topic 128 (Value): recipients, care, imposing, systems, allowing, my, realized, own, listening, wishes
Summary: realized that one must give and not only take. Listening more to care recipients’ wishes than before.

Topic 129 (Asceticism): asceticism, modern, gravity, necessities, petrifying, wealth, freedom, develops, enough, suspect
Summary: “Modern asceticism” was understood negatively as being a result of elderly people’s withdrawal from the outside world. Here we might suspect the indirect or direct influence of under- lying assumptions from activity theory.

Topic 130 (Gutmann): mastery, magical, passive, toward, gutmann, movement, projected, druze, universal, pictures
Summary: Gutmann found a common pattern in all societies: young men dem- onstrated what was called active mastery in their projections of the TAT- pictures. The old men demonstrated passive mastery or magical mastery.

Topic 131 (Flower): flower, you, your, mountain, see, landscape, beauty, leaves, try, imagine
Summary: Go outdoors and find a beautiful flower of your liking. Concentrate on that flower and contemplate the fact that you and this flower are made of the very same basic molecular components.

Topic 132 (Measures): method, measures, methods, distribution, and, , , , , 
Summary: Method and Measures

Topic 133 (Gerotranscendence): twenty, ten, fifty, becoming, unchanged, nuisance, ahead, lies, message, best
Summary: Some of us admit that at age ten we wished to never grow older. Being twenty was felt to be the essence of life, while the thought of becoming fifty was gruesome and seen as the end of the fun.

Topic 134 (Elderly): he, kerman, activation, elderly, resource, perspective, research, start, project, over
Summary: A national Swedish gerontology research project back in the 1970s, “The Elderly in Society,” started with some theoretical points of departure that were partly new at that time. “Passive” pensioners who do not share a “normal” interest in career work, leisure-time activities, and keep-fit measures are regarded as problematic.

Topic 135 (Altruism): altruism, egoism, occur, shift, matter, may, special, lifelong, male, description
Summary: Self-transcendence. A shift may occur from egoism to altruism.

Topic 136 (Transcended): present, they, live, time, percep, belongs, say, retrospect, difficulty, yesterday
Summary: Many of us have a tendency to define the present time of life as the best one and as normative for how the rest of life should be. We can understand otherwise in retrospect, but have difficulty doing.

Topic 137 (Findings): loneliness, minority, onto, empirical, 1971, match, miseries, 1985, tell, doesn
Summary: There are severe mismatches between the nuisances and miseries we tend to project onto old age and what those who have reached advanced age tell themselves. For example, the supposed “retire- ment shock’ seems not to be the common pattern, but rather the exception for a tiny minority.

Topic 138 (Aging): overlooked, decrease, occupied, rational, flesh, relying, blood, theoreticians, desk, interest
Summary: The gerotranscendent individual typically experiences a redefinition of the self and of relationships to others. The individual becomes, for example, less self-occupied and at the same time more selective in the choice of social and other activities.

Topic 139 (Gerotranscendence): footnotes, academic, accessible, versed, technological, technicalities, skip, reviewed, elucidation, matters
Summary: This chapter has reviewed the beginning of the theory of gerotrans- cendence. The following chapters report on the search for empirical evidence and elucidation.

Topic 140 (Listen): doing, things, others, me, myself, egotistically, benefit, sake, because, ll
Summary: I talked very egotistically about how I was doing. It was me all the time  I never listened to my children.

Topic 141 (Entrepreneurs): higher, metropolitan, entrepreneurs, degrees, collar, white, rules, cosmic, transcendence, work
Summary: The degree of cosmic transcendence is correlated with the type of work the respondent had before retirement, and with social class. Respondents who had white-collar work or were metropolitan entrepreneurs had somewhat higher degrees of Cosmic transcendence than others.

Topic 142 (Owning): want, own, knives, packed, owns, locked, china, spoons, isn, simple
Summary: I want to own as little property as I can. It’s tiresome to own .

Topic 143 (Unpack): owning, material, possessions, nice, recommended, collecting, burdensome, binding, unpack, thematic
Summary: One obstacle was identified in the above thematic survey—unnecessary material assets. Even if none of the respondents advocated pure asceticism, several spontaneously argued that owning too much may be burdensome and binding.

Topic 144 (Coherence): coherence, correlates, 61, dictors, reporting, conducted, versus, discover, remains, pre
Summary: We conducted a CHAID analysis, with coherence as the dependent variable and a series of other variables as possible pre- dictors. The analysis reveals a rather strong correlation with age.

Topic 145 (Coherence): widowers, unmarried, widows, divorced, lower, coherence, values, flats, housing, incomes
Summary: Unmarried and divorced respondents had lower values than did widows/widowers and married or cohabiting respondents. Individuals with higher incomes had higher coherence values, while indi-

Topic 146 (Isolated): maybe, inside, physically, isolated, mentally, energy, together, physical, too, get
Summary: "They are very isolated. .

Topic 147 (Greta): greta, she, herself, died, radiate, widow, discouraging, mother, daughter, arrives
Summary: Greta is a former schoolteacher, 72 years of age at the time of the interview. She grew up in a quiet and safe middle-class environment.

Topic 148 (Misery): misery, resource, perspective, root, applied, proved, liked, completely, vitality, very
Summary: The resource perspective may be nothing other than the old misery perspective in a new, ingenious, theoretical disguise. In the following, we will give a couple of examples of central “misery myths” within the discipline that have proved to have a great vitality.

Topic 149 (Gerotranscendence): head, soup, swallows, nettles, flying, arrows, nettle, patch, pick, my
Summary: Our respondents gave several examples of what could be called mediating links or bridges to different aspects of gerotranscendence. Eva talked about how experiences of nature give her life meaning.

Topic 150 (Transcendence): transcended, limbo, ignoring, silently, sounds, sitting, sacred, movements, barrier, time
Summary: Sitting together silently, they transcended the borders of past and future time. By ignoring movements and sounds around them, they also transcended space.

Topic 151 (Coherence): fear, coherence, correlates, death, satisfaction37, 39, 38, cantly, sought, moderately
Summary: The coherence scale correlates strongly with life satisfaction37 and moderately with fear of death. The higher the degree of coherence, the higher the life satisfaction and the lower the fear ofDeath.

Topic 152 (Danish): 1990, holst, almind, holstein, danish, please, specified, collection, procedures, specifically
Summary: The analysis refers to a cross- sectional analysis of the first 1990 Danish retrospective study. Details of the sampling and data collection procedures are

Topic 153 (Gerotranscendence): incidence, modifiers, factors, circumstances, autonomous, database, matrix, modify, ingly, liberation
Summary: Life crises seem- ingly affect the dimensions of gerotranscendence, as do profession and income. A possible interpretation of the latter is that an autonomous life contributes to a liberation from rules and values.

Topic 154 (Correlation): ing, overwhelm, overwhelming, magnitude, 31, speak, highly, though, reduced, theoretically
Summary: The above-mentioned correlations are not in themselves overwhelm- ing in magnitude, but they are theoretically very interesting.

Topic 155 (Myths): sociology, myths, restrain, undermined, clues, uncovering, tied, keeps, nurture, freeing
Summary: Why do we still nurture myths related to negative images? The sociology of knowledge and the sociology of science give us some useful clues.

Topic 156 (65): summing, up, moving, focus, 65, on, with, and, the, 
Summary: Summing up and Moving

Topic 157 (Dying): death, dying, fear, preparation, maturation, comprehension, disappears, generally, live, decreases
Summary: I don't live in order to die, I want to live. implicit in maturation is a greater and greater capacity for dying.

Topic 158 (Dare): dare, enough, bunch, okay, succeeded, dumb, stupid, coming, bit, done
Summary: "I’m old enough and wise enough to dare to do dumb things. Now I don’t care a bit about what people think

Topic 159 (Play): said, anymore, fun, woman, year, waning, glamorous, bourgeoisie, charm, discreet
Summary: Some respondents said they had not changed at all in this regard, but an even greater number said that they had. “Those superficial things that were fun when I was younger are not fun in the same way anymore,” said a 79-year-old woman.

Topic 160 (Developmental): 1950, eighth, 1982, erikson, descrip, stories, last, stage, development, tried
Summary: The stories told by our respondents were very similar to Erikson’s descrip- tion of the last and eighth stage of development. A 65-year-old woman said:

Topic 161 (Integrity): my, integrity, wanted, wholeness, feeling, ego, lot, depended, depend, lately
Summary: Many respondents told about the difficulty to achieve, or preserve, the experience of ego-integrity. A 62-year-old man said that the feeling of wholeness and coherence in life that has come lately is not stable.

Topic 162 (Solitude): 14, experienced, systematic, crisis, solitude, need, systematically, having, figure, pattern
Summary: In Figure 4.14 this pattern is also shown for those having and not having experienced a crisis in life during the last two years. The need for solitude also shows a pattern in which aging seems to reduce the impact of crises.

Topic 163 (Childhood): she, childhood, recalling, heard, remember, her, my, scares, frightened, pleases
Summary: A 79-year-old woman expressed a similar view saying that it both pleases and scares her: “Now I’m almost 80 and now I dare to remember my childhood”

Topic 164 (Aging): activity, maladjustment, beneficial, kinds, physical, assumes, lack, fundamentally, costs, families
Summary: The research problem for the interdisciplinary project has been set in such a way that it is a matter of finding solutions to how long it is possible to postpone the transition for aging people. For the individual, such a lengthened period of activity would mean a richer and more substantial life.

Topic 165 (Retirement): retirement, trauma, materialize, bottom, aldwin, timing, findings, recurrent, paul, coberly
Summary: The trauma expected by many scholars in connection with retirement does not materialize in empirical research. Aldwin (1990) has shown that retirement generally has a very low stress value.

Topic 166 (Aging): confrontation, belonged, resembling, invisible, introduce, conversations, forth, attributed, member, discuss
Summary: In the Wadensten and Carlsson (2001) study self-confrontation belonged to the ‘invisible’ group of signs and none of the staff had observed anything resembling it. Do discuss in a group or

Topic 167 (Transcendence): combination, maximum, adult, first, enhanced, 53, variables51, develop, half, 84
Summary: The need for solitude increases to a maximum in late life, but seems to develop most rapidly during the first half of adult life. With more of cosmic transcendence (and coherence) comes more satisfaction with life.

Topic 168 (Death): withdraw, attend, funerals, talks, speak, someone, stimulate, listen, ques, thoughts
Summary: Old people don't want new contacts. Do listen when someone talks about death, let them speak,

Topic 169 (Crises): coher, produce, middleage, seeking, crises, seem, experience, creased, ence, late

Topic 170 (Gerotranscendence): activities, tive, positively, correlated, lack, rests, initia, preferring, selec, observer
Summary: We shed the company and activities that lack content, we become more selec- tive, preferring literature or music, or a few friends. Not because of lack of possibilities, but of choice.
