"o you remember when you were ten years of age and what you, at that time, thought about those who were twenty years of age?",133,Gerotranscendence,0.9599099610234011
"This question has been forwarded to several audiences as a first thread in the theory of gerotranscendence. The answers have recurrently been laughter and declarations that the twenty-year-old seemed very old indeed. Some of us admit that at age ten we wished to never grow older. Age ten was thought to be the very best in life. So, at age ten, the message was this: If everything could just continue unchanged as it is now, life would be at its very best. What lies ahead is nothing to look forward to.",133,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"And then we grew older and turned twenty. What did we, at age twenty, think about ourselves as ten, and what about the prospect of turning fifty? The answers to these questions were new laughter and statements about seeing oneself as very childish and immature at age ten and that becoming twenty was a pleasure rather than a nuisance. At the same time, the prospect of becoming fifty was very negative. Being twenty was felt to be the essence of life, while the thought of becoming fifty was gruesome and seen as the end of the fun. So, at age twenty, the message was now this: If everything could just continue unchanged as it is now, life would be at its very best. What lies ahead is nothing to look forward to.",133,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"Sure enough, those of us who have reached age fifty often praise the maturity of that time. Becoming fifty was a pleasure rather than a nuisance, and we pitied the poor twenty-year-olds, running around like hysteric mice in a maze. “Thank God for not having to suffer that age any longer.” But, for sure, being eighty would be a real nuisance and a misery, including retirement shock, loss of friends, and loneliness. So, at age fifty, the message was still: If everything could just continue unchanged as it is now, life would be at its very best. What lies ahead is nothing to look forward to.",133,Gerotranscendence,0.8284413096048282
"So, it seems, many of us have a tendency to define the present time of life as the best one and as normative for how the rest of life should be. We can understand otherwise in retrospect, but have difficulty doing",136,Transcended,1.0

"so in prospect. This is, in fact, a particular aspect of something more general—the centricity patterns. We talk about, for example, ethnocen- trism, and refer to a pattern where one’s own ethnic group is perceived as natural and best, while other groups are defined as strange and inferior. They become “others” in an “othering” process sometimes ending in xenophobia. In the same vein there are othering processes regarding culture, social class, age, gender, and many more. This is probably one of the reasons to why, when younger, we tend to project a series of nuisances and miseries on old age, in the same vein as the ten-year-old projects misfortune as a result of becoming twenty, and the twenty-year- old projects other nuisances and miseries as a result of becoming fifty.",23,Gerontological,0.27369788277013657
"Not surprisingly there are severe mismatches between the nuisances and miseries we tend to project onto old age and what those who have reached advanced age tell themselves. For example, the supposed “retire- ment shock” seems not to be the common pattern, but rather the exception for a tiny minority (Streib & Schneider 1971; Atchley, 1971, 1999, 1980; Parnes & Nestel, 1981; Palmore, Burchett, Fillenbaum, George, & Wall- man, 1985; Tornstam, 1973; Rehn, 1984; O¨ sterberg, 1982). Likewise, the assumed general loneliness among the elderly seems to be a minority problem rather than a general pattern. There are even empirical studies showing that the largest “minority” suffering from feelings of loneliness are people in the 20–29 age group, not older people (Tornstam, 1990). However, despite the fact that the empirical data contradicts our beliefs, we seem to continue projecting these miseries onto old age. Al- ready in 1985 Robinson, Coberly, and Paul made the observation that assumptions about retirement connected with stress and morbidity con-",137,Findings,1.0
tinue to flourish despite tons of contradicting empirical data. We social scientists seem so convinced of the correctness of our theories and hypoth- eses that we have a tendency to disregard the facts.,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"What we most often do when reality, as seen in empirical studies, doesn’t match our theories is criticize the study in order to keep the theory. When we, for example, do not find that old people feel as lonely as our theories make us assume, we start asking questions about sampling procedures, ways of analysis, and underestimation—the sample was wrong, the analysis was made poorly, and people were reluctant to tell the truth about loneliness. That’s why the data doesn’t match the theory. In this way it is possible to leave the thesis of old-age loneliness intact.",137,Findings,1.0
"But, if we for once allow the thought that our projections on old age might be erroneous and the empirical data correct, we must question",21,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"the projections and the theory instead. This is exactly what the theory of gerotranscendence, the topic of this book, is about. The perpetual mis- match between theory and certain empirical data is one of the things that has led us to believe that we sometimes erroneously project midlife values, activity patterns, and expectations onto old age, and then define these values, patterns, and expectations as successful aging. Maybe our projec- tions are not only rooted in midlife, but also in Western culture and White middle-class hopes for “success” to continue into old age.",21,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"Sure enough, the concept “successful aging” entered the field of gerontology early and is still in popular use. When scratching the surface of the concept it comes to the fore that aging successfully most often is understood as continuing to be a Western-cultured, White, middle-aged, middle-class successful person, with the typical emphasis on activity, pro- ductivity, efficiency, individuality, independence, wealth, health, and so- ciability. Scholars, as well as ordinary men and women may unconsciously project this specific middle-age value and behavioral pattern on old age, expressed as normative theories or facts about aging. In the theory of gerotranscendence we are questioning all this. Instead of accepting the hidden assumption that good aging is the same as continuing the midlife pattern indefinitely, we suggest that growing into old age has its very own meaning and character. By doing so, we at the same time suggest that there is a continuous development into old age. This is in contrast to much of the thinking within gerontology, where continuity and stability rather than change and development are key concepts.",21,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"In order to find and describe the hidden or overlooked developmental character and meaning of old age, we are going to listen to what old people themselves say about this, rather than relying on the statements of young and middle-aged desk theoreticians. We will then be able to demonstrate that aging certainly can involve some overlooked develop- mental changes related to increased life satisfaction, as described by real, flesh and blood individuals. The gerotranscendent individual, as we shall see, typically experiences a redefinition of the self and of relationships to others and a new understanding of fundamental, existential questions. The individual becomes, for example, less self-occupied and at the same time more selective in the choice of social and other activities. There is an increased feeling of affinity with past generations and a decrease in interest in superfluous social interaction. The individual might also experi- ence a decrease in interest in material things and a greater need for solitary “meditation.” Positive solitude becomes more important. There is also",138,Aging,1.0
"often a feeling of cosmic communion with the spirit of the universe, and a redefinition of time, space, life, and death.",16,Rejoicing,1.0
"However, gerotranscendence does not imply any state of withdrawal or disengagement, as is sometimes erroneously believed. It is not the old disengagement theory in a new disguise, as believed by some critics (e.g., Biggs, Hendricks, & Lowenstein, 2003). It is a theory that describes a developmental pattern beyond the old dualism of activity and disen- gagement. This book will explore this developmental pattern.",120,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"At the same time as the book gives a detailed account of the theory of gerotranscendence, it also describes how the theory was developed from the unsatisfying mismatch of common theoretical assumptions within gerontology and some empirical findings. This does not mean, of course, that all the established theories within social gerontology are useless, just that there are certain developmental patterns that they don’t cover properly.",0,Gerontology,1.0
"The book starts out with a discussion of the unsatisfying state of the art and what generally is needed in order to bring theory and certain empirical findings into harmony. The theory of gerotranscendence is then developed as an answer to this plea, starting out as a tentative outline in chapter 2, and followed in chapter 3 by a qualitative specification based on firsthand, in-depth interviews with individuals of a mature age who themselves have experienced the individual development in life, which we have come to call gerotranscendence.",37,Gerotranscendence,0.8253422547513433
"In chapter 4 the gerotranscendence pattern is further elucidated by quantitative studies of various kinds. In chapter 5, the practical implica- tions of the theory are brought into focus. Here you will find how the theory has been translated into guidelines for work within care settings. Finally, in chapter 6, you will find a summary of the preceding information and a conclusion. The appendix contains some suggestions for how to facilitate personal development towards gerotranscendence. This book is partly based on and further develops what previously has been written on the subject in different forums (e.g., by Tornstam from 1989 to 2003).",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"In order to make the book accessible for those who are not versed in research and technological matters, most of these technicalities have been placed in footnotes for those who need this information. If your interest is not academic, you can skip reading the footnotes and still acquire an understanding of the theory of gerotranscendence.",139,Gerotranscendence,1.0
It should be carefully noted that the theory of gerotranscendence is not formulated with the aim of nullifying other theories within social,8,Gerotranscendence,0.7247913638352794

Knowing about the theory of gerotrans- cendence can then be like the coin that makes the slot machine work, or like the new pair of eyeglasses that make you see the world in a new way—a theoretical tool that makes certain parts of reality comprehensible. We do not pretend that the theory of gerotranscendence is better or “normative free” in comparison with other theories, but rather that it covers certain aspects of individual aging processes which previously have not been sufficiently covered by social gerontology theory. It might be for such reasons that individuals time and again report that the theory of gerotranscendence captures much of their personal experiences of aging. In letters, phone calls, e-mails, and oral declarations after lectures, such testimonies have been given by a considerable number of individuals, ranging from retired university professors, a former ambassador, and a couple of novelists, to very ordinary, retired, white-collar workers and other working folk. These spontaneous testimonies tell us that the theory corresponds to the experiences of aging that a number of individuals have actually had.",71,Gerotranscendence,0.8949005992611123

How shall these changes be understood? Are they part of a negative withdrawal or a developing wisdom? Let’s have a look on what theories in social gerontology have to offer.,0,Gerontology,1.0
"The most useful practical tool for understanding is said to be a good theory. No surprise then that theoretical renewing is asked for repeatedly. In a description of the theoretical state of the art Bengtson, Burgess, and Parrot (1997) concluded that we still have some distance to go. More attention should be given to theory. At the very beginning of this new century this plea is still advocated as in, for example, a book with the title The Need for Theory—Critical Approaches to Social Gerontology (Biggs, Hendricks, & Lowenstein, 2003).",0,Gerontology,0.8943363202629089
"Theorizing within social gerontology has been organized regarding content and theoretical level as well as historical development (see, for example, Estes, Binney, & Culbertson, 1992; Bengtson, Parrott, & Bur- gess, 1996; Bengtson, Burgess, & Parrott, 1997), but this is not the place to account for this. It is sufficient to say that we are going to deal with theorizing on the micro to intermediate level, and with a developmental perspective focusing on the individual. It might also be mentioned that regarding the efforts to label and systematize theories, the theory of gerotranscendence has been placed in a box with the label “critical theory” (Bengtson, Burgess, & Parrott, 1997).",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"When theories are the target of discussions, however, we sometimes refer to different entities. Some of us only count as theories such a set of propositions (axioms) from which invariance hypotheses can be derived and tested quantitatively. We are then referring to formalized theories. Other definitions of a theory focus on the fact that a theory always is a way of comprehending reality, not necessarily by means of any system of formal axioms and hypotheses, but rather as a shorthand for understanding or characterizing a phenomenon. In the latter case, the way of classifying and understanding reality is more important than the set of axioms and hypotheses used to formalize this understanding. Stevens Barnum (1990) is an example of those having a definition close to the latter position, while Galtung (1969) exemplifies a position closer to the former, formalized understanding of what a theory is.",0,Gerontology,1.0
"Our own opinion is that a theory first and above all has the mission to offer ways of understanding and comprehending reality. Forgetting this and focusing on the formal aspects only might lead to a fruitless and mechanical manipulation of details. So, when we take a look at some theorizing within social gerontology in what follows, it is with a focus on which ways of understanding reality the theories offer, not “if” or “how” these understandings are formalized.",0,Gerontology,1.0
"Among the many ways of understanding what aging is about on the individual level, more or less overlapping perspectives can be mentioned. The following list of some common approaches is introduced for the purpose only of illustrating that we see different things depending on which pair of theoretical glasses we use. For a fuller description of the different theoretical approaches you will have to consult a general textbook on theories in social gerontology.",71,Gerotranscendence,1.0

"As mentioned in the introduction, it might be that our “understand- ing” of aging and how it ought to be, the normative part of the “under- standing,” is quite affected by our own position in life and society, and not randomly selected from the above mentioned and other possible perspectives. This should, however, not be any surprise, since sociology of science have taught us that science in general and social science, in particular social gerontology, never is absolute or final. It is selective and relative.",68,Elderly,1.0
This relativity exists on several different levels. One level has to do with how the general ideas about aging and elderly people are relative to,57,Elderly,0.6328394950045433
"our own position in life, as described in the introduction to this book. Another level has to do with how the empirical knowledge is directed by the choice of theoretical points of departure. A third level has to do with how the choice itself of theoretical points of departure is relative to cultural and historical relationships. With illustrations from a number of studies, we will show how poorly many of the research findings correlate with our theoretical assumptions, and how difficult it is, despite this, to abandon the theoretical points of departure that we have chosen. We will argue that the usual theoretical points of departure for gerontological research only represent a narrow corridor in a theoretical field, which actually is much broader. We will also argue that it is not just by chance that we choose these very theoretical points of departure. The ways we chose to construct old age in our theories are directed not only by our own position in the life cycle, but also by an overflow of predominant, general values from society into science.",0,Gerontology,1.0
"A national Swedish gerontology research project back in the 1970s, “The Elderly in Society,” started with some theoretical points of departure that were partly new at that time. The most central of these was one which came to be called the resource perspective, which quickly gained great popularity. This perspective is close to what today is known as the salutogenic perspective (Antonovsky, 1987). As opposed to the, at that time, prevailing way to “construct” old age as a misery and old people as a burden, we were encouraged to see older people as resources. This new resource perspective would not only expose a number of popular public myths about the elderly, but would also call our attention to our own theoretical constructions within the discipline of gerontology.",134,Elderly,1.0
"The consciousness that the understanding of aging can be constructed from both a misery perspective and a resource perspective released new knowledge early in the research process. In the first research report from the project we (Tornstam, 1981) could show how younger people overestimated the problem-reality of the elderly, compared with how the elderly themselves defined it. The omission of the everyday reality of the elderly was guided by a misery perspective, rather than anything else. Further information of the same kind was presented later (Tornstam, 1983a) where it was shown that knowledge about the actual conditions of the elderly was vague and that it had a quite pessimistic coloring.",85,Aging,1.0
THE ROOT OF THE MISERY PERSPECTIVE,148,Misery,1.0
"Why do our pictures of the elderly look the way they do? Why do we frequently depict the elderly as sicker, feebler, and more miserable than",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"they are in reality? Above all, why do we still, in gerontology, nurture myths related to these negative images? The sociology of knowledge and the sociology of science give us some useful clues.",155,Myths,1.0
"In the contemporary sociology of knowledge there is evidence that science is not as “scientific” as was once believed. Even if it had long been known that that the direction and speed of scientific development was related to the society in which it was developed, it was later accepted that the core content of science—the concepts, the theories, and the way of interpreting data—was also related to the society around the sheltered scientific community (Young, 1973; Lemaine, et al., 1976).",56,Scientific,0.5553869963114703
"Much of the very substance of science is nothing but “common sense,” which, imported from the surrounding society, becomes an integral part of recognized scientific practice (Elliot, 1974). Holton (1973) argued that all scientists import, from the surrounding society, basic presuppositions that inform and guide their work. They commit themselves to assumptions of conflict or consensus, development or equilibrium, or to a misery or resource perspective. These presuppositions are often taken as “givens,” and can be looked upon as an unconscious overflow from society to science. In the following we are using the term overflow to refer not only to the input of basic presuppositions from society to scientific theory, but also to the fact that such basic presuppositions affect the way in which empirical research is carried out and interpreted.",56,Scientific,1.0
"As a typical example of this phenomenon, Mulkay (1979) analyzed the development of the Darwinian theory and concluded that it was based to a large extent on what he termed “informal thinking.” The major interpretations proposed were not based directly on observation of biolog- ical phenomena. Rather they were taken over from practical activities and from the wider realm of philosophical, theological, and social debate to provide the framework within which the observations were given scientific meaning. Sometimes, as in the above-mentioned case, the overflow from society to science turns out to be fruitful; sometimes it can badly distort science, as in the case of Lysenko, described by Joravsky (1970). Based on dubious genetic research on vegetables, Lysenko came up with the suggestion that acquired qualities could be inherited. An idea which was appealing to the political leaders in the old U.S.S.R., who saw a possibility to create socialist individuals from birth. Lots of resources were invested in Lysenkos’s research before the bubble burst in the mid 1960s. Today the name Lysenko stands for politically directed pseudoscience.",84,Scientists,0.49330270451904484
"Gerontology, too, can be seen to participate in the use of societal overflow in formulating its theoretical points of departure. As Gubrium",0,Gerontology,1.0
"and Wallace (1990) pointed out, there are striking parallels between ordinary people’s way of thinking about age and aging and the theoretical products of professional peers. Estes, Binney and Culbertson (1992) make a similar observation when they point out functionalism as a very powerful ideology affecting gerontology. Functionalism is “ . . . rooted in American traditions of individualism, self-reliance, and independence, and posits that cohe- sion and social harmony are natural” (p. 51). Bengtson, Parrott, and Burgess (1996) conclude that there has not yet been any definable paradigmatic shift in gerontological theorizing. They herein include the very first steps towards the theory of gerotranscendence.",68,Elderly,0.7212368579559503
"Our thesis is, however, that the overflow of functionalistic presuppo- sitions, values, and “common sense” from white middle-class, middle- aged Western European society explains, in part, why gerontology nur- tures some very persistent theoretical assumptions, even when the empiri- cal reality contradicts the theories. As Hickey (1992) observed, there is quite much of the same in the way gerontologists have addressed their issues, despite seemingly new approaches and developments.",0,Gerontology,1.0
The Hidden Contempt for Weakness,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"White, Western, middle-class, middle-life society has, since the Reforma- tion, been characterized by an overwhelmingly strong performance orien- tation. Productivity, effectiveness, and independence are prestige words. What happens to those in our society who do not live up to the ideal of productivity, effectiveness, and independence? The Norwegian philosopher, Harald Ofstad (1972), has in a thought-provoking book, Our Contempt for Weakness, described what happens. Quite simply, we come to look down upon and hold in contempt those who are unproductive, ineffective, and dependent. To the extent that this applies to ourselves, we will do the same. We will regard ourselves with self-contempt. It is here we find the basis for contempt towards unproductive, ineffective, and dependent old people, and a basis for the mismatch between theory",83,Values,1.0
and empirical findings.,29,Pathology,0.9125508778205347
"However, the value patterns of our society have several different cultural sources. One is the old Hebrew tradition, where age and wisdom are held in high esteem. This is in conflict with the value patterns that generate contempt for the elderly. Ofstad suggests that we tend to “solve” this conflict by hiding the contempt, or by changing it into something that allows it to be united with the respect for the elderly found in the Hebrew tradition.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"What happens, according to Ofstad, is that we transform the con- tempt into a condescending pity. We feel so sorry for the poor, feeble, sick, and lonely old people. We feel so sorry for them to the extent that we force ourselves to “construct” them in a way that confirms that we are right when we feel sorry for them. It is a well-known psychological fact that we often perceive or construct reality in congruence with our need to apprehend it, rather than as it really is. We have a need to perceive the elderly as feeble and weak, in order for us to feel sorry for them. Thus, the false image of the elderly as miserable is produced, and we “solve” the problem of our contempt for unproductive, ineffective, and dependent old people. In other words, the myths—seen from this perspec- tive—have the function of solving the problem of our contempt for weak- ness in the elderly.",85,Aging,1.0

MYTHS WITHIN GERONTOLOGY,0,Gerontology,1.0
"That the researcher also has a tendency to regard the elderly from a misery perspective was demonstrated by A˚ kerman (1981), who carried out a historical research project among elderly persons in a depopulated parish in northern Sweden. He had expected to find abandoned and lonely old people, but instead found well-integrated old people having a rich social life with good contact with their children. The expectations he had corresponded poorly with the reality he met, and he was sufficiently open to note the difference. In the conclusion of the research report A˚ kerman wrote:",134,Elderly,1.0
"Our study has shown that the isolation and the fairly pitiable situation that is often conjured up in the press and on the radio and TV by no means seems to afflict all elderly people, even in a depopulated village.

The Supposed Effects of Modernization,23,Gerontological,1.0
"The expectations A˚ kerman carried with him into his research project are not only derived from general mythical ideas about the elderly, but also from a well-established theoretical background which, at the same time, constitutes an example of how firmly entrenched these theoretical points of departure are, and how difficult they are to revise, even if the empirical reality contradicts the theories. The theoretical background in question focuses on the supposed conditions in the old peasant society, and the negative effects that the modernization of society by industrialization and urbanization is supposed to have had. But, for example, the concept of the happy, extended or three-generation family as the dominating pattern in the old peasant society has, however, been refuted relatively early from several quarters.

"Contrary to the common assumption that the processes of industrial- ization and urbanization distanced older people and their children from each other, empirical studies have repeatedly shown that today’s elderly, in general, stand out as being well integrated in society, and as having good contact with their children, with only a small minority being socially isolated (Babchuk & Beates, 1963; Shanas, 1968; Hess, 1972; Roos, 1975; Tornstam, 1978; Atchley, 2000). However, despite numerous empirical studies that contradict the mythical pictures, these myths seem to have a life of their own, unperturbed by contradictory research results.

"This is an example of the ingenious way the researcher can save his or her favorite theory. Hareven’s message was that the theory is correct, but that the effect that the theory presupposes has not had time to make itself apparent. The present good social integration and contact between the generations that gerontological studies document are taken to be a remnant of the good relations that existed earlier in society. Now, it just happens to be that these earlier conditions, at least in Europe, were not good at all. Historians have shown that the earlier conditions for the elderly rather could be characterized by poverty and heart-rending con- flicts between generations, and by a poor social integration for the elderly (Gaunt, 1983; Ode´n, 1991, 2002).",23,Gerontological,0.19751758070497988

So, not surprisingly, within the Swedish research program, “The Elderly in Society,” we were also guilty of clinging to this favorite theory about the negative effects on the elderly of industrialism and urbanization. In the same way as Haraven did, we (Tornstam 1983b) referred to the theory of cultural lag in order to “explain away” the good social integration and the good contact between the generations which earlier empirical studies have shown. In fact, the purpose of one of the partial projects within the research program was to examine the effect industrialization and urbanization have had on solidarity between the generations.

"Many gerontologists have put forward the hypothesis of the negative effects of retirement, in regard to both psychological well-being and physical health. Even if the discussions sometimes have tried to take into account both positive and negative aspects of retirement, the very frame of reference has mostly taken its point of departure from negative aspects.

Thus the argument has followed—and with considerable justification—that any tampering with the work role, the great balancing factor in life, runs the risk of creating a profound alienation and disequilibrium among the affected individuals. In an environment characterized by a religious devotion to work and peopled by individuals dedicated to conspicuous production as an important means of self-identification and self-justifica- tion, retirement would be expected to have social as well as economic significance.

Atchley (1971, 1980), Parnes and Nestel (1981), and Palmore, et al. (1985) are examples of the many who have arrived at similar conclusions.

Some then, as in the above Townsend example, explain the data away as wishful thinking on behalf of the respondents, while others accept the data as valid, and move towards new lines of thought, but still prefer to focus on the minority with problems, rather than asking the question why we bring with us all the misery expectations.

If it was only one single longitudinal study at hand, such an “explanation” might possibly be accepted.

"It has been stressed that stereotyped ideas about aging and elderly people are linked with the need to categorize and systematize the reality that surrounds us (Tornstam, 1983c). The same is true, of course, for science in general and gerontology in particular. Scientific theories can be understood as special ways of categorizing and systematizing reality to make it understandable and to create order in life. Sometimes this need for order and understanding leads to oversimplification, which can partially explain a persisting tendency to focus on homogeneity and central tendencies in studies of aging rather than on variance and heterogeneity. There was a time in the history of science when people thought there was a final way of categorizing reality, an order that was the final and correct one. In their book, Science, Order and Creativity, Bohm and Peat (1987) describe how the idea about the true order within the “firm” sciences evolved from classical antiquity to our time. As far back as the fourth century B.C., Aristotle wrote about an eternal order where every- thing had its given place in the natural scheme of things. During the Middle Ages, these ideas had such a strong impact that they became the basic foundation for religion, philosophy, and morality—indeed, for the whole white Western social order. These ideas came to be the central, basic assumptions upon which other scientific theories and assumptions about society rested.

When Copernicus suggested that the Earth and the other planets were in orbit around the sun, his hypothesis was nothing less than a revolutionary shift of paradigm. Not only the image of the cosmic system but all scientific theories were changed by this shift.

With such a fundamental point of departure for the scientific work, it is not difficult to understand why the descriptions of aging and the conditions of the elderly easily led to a “misery perspective.” Making various miseries visible is usually the best argumentation for new sociopolitical measures, and the myths within the discipline serve the purpose of making “scientific” arguments for the desired changes. Gerontological research shows quite a few examples of interpretations of reality seen from a problem-elevating perspective, the purpose of which has been precisely to bring about sociopolitical changes or other kinds of changes intended to improve the conditions of the elderly.",57,Elderly,0.5588832524671702
"Now, of course, we do not argue that it is reprehensible to try to make visible the problems that are visited upon on the elderly. This should continue to be one of the tasks of gerontological research. However, the problem arises when we go over to being advocates for the elderly to such an extent that we start to manipulate our science. In certain cases such a manipulation can take place consciously and premeditatedly by holding back research results that do not fit, or by presenting them in a",57,Elderly,1.0
way that serves the goal one wishes to attain. In other cases we uncon- sciously choose concepts or theories that agree with the purpose of making problems visible and bringing about change.,56,Scientific,0.6541772197006186
"We would like to dare make the statement that for most gerontolo- gists there is a point of departure of this kind. We have a basic humanitar- ian wish to contribute to improvements being made for the elderly. This desire has certainly been stimulated by a research policy emphasizing that research should be “relevant to society” in the sense that it should be converted into practical measures as fast as possible. In this case, useful, practically-applied research has been emphasized in preference to basic research.",57,Elderly,1.0
"Once again it must be repeated that there is nothing wrong with this type of incentive to gerontological research. However, at the same time, it must be understood that this incentive presents a problem. It is difficult to prevent the choice of research paradigm from being directed by the mentioned incentive. The choice of conceptual apparatus and theoretical points of departure are chosen so that they fit the purpose of making visible problems and bringing about changes. This might take place at the expense of other choices of perspective, which, from the point of view of basic research, can be more interesting.",0,Gerontology,1.0
"The sum total of this problem is that the individual gerontologist must ask himself the questions 1) to what extent is the humanitarian motive a driving force in the research, and 2) in what way does it guide the choice of conceptual limitations and theoretical points of departure. Overall, we gerontologists must try to think a little more freely and boldly in order to widen the theoretical perspective of our discipline. We must dare to question the “sacred cows” that our traditional theories constitute and break the bounds of our theoretical corral.",0,Gerontology,1.0
BREAKING THE BOUNDS,13,Staff,0.265857648838787
"One way of breaking the bounds of the predominant gerontological para- digm might be quite simply to reverse the gerontological research para- digm in order to see which concepts and theories would then come to the fore. Such a reverse paradigm should not be seen as the new indisput- able one, but rather as an intellectual tool that might help us to see things we have not seen earlier, and to teach us how to break out of the traditional paradigm.",0,Gerontology,1.0
"An experimental reverse gerontological paradigm might look like this: It is not the researchers who define concepts and theories in the first place, but the elderly themselves. Concepts and connections take their form from the way old people themselves structure and discern reality. This leads to a different research effort whereby the elderly cease to be research objects and instead become co-creating subjects. As earlier suggested by imaginative gerontologists (e.g., Neugarten, 1977; Coleman, 1990), the phenomenological research effort comes to the fore. The phe- nomenological research effort, like modern physics, has as its starting point the insight that there is no single truth, nor any absolute natural order of things. Here, one strives to get new images to emerge from reality. Above all, one tries to free oneself from the limiting conceptual world of the researcher in order to, instead, attach greater importance to the conceptual world that is defined by others—e.g., by the research objects themselves (Spinelli, 1989). As expressed by Coleman (1990), the researcher, rather than in the positivist tradition looking for causal or mechanistic explanations of observed behavior, ought to be encouraged to seek a fuller description and understanding of behavior and conscious- ness by elaborating the meaning that it has for the individual. May we suggest that this could take the following form:",68,Elderly,1.0
"We consciously choose to try to replace the overflow presuppositions with alternative ones, and let these alternative prepositions direct the conceptual and theoretical development. In practice we would allow ourselves to play with the thought that ineffectiveness, unproduc- tiveness, and dependency are guiding values. This could result in focusing on concepts such as rest, relaxation, comfortable laziness and play, and creativity and wisdom.",56,Scientific,0.6309360721507351
"If the strong emphasis on the points of departure for the role and activity theories is toned down, then theories with their points of departure in, for example, philosophy and anthropology can come to throw new light on gerontological research.",0,Gerontology,1.0
"With a reverse definition of what is regarded as normal or pathologi- cal, there will be new tasks of understanding, for example, why some elderly people hang on to the mid-life ideal of productive work and self-punishing exercise programs, and why we, in various keep-fit programs place sole responsibility on the individual, thus creating a sense of failure in those reluctant or unable to meet our expectations.",85,Aging,1.0
"Without an attempt to break free from the traditional, sometimes mythical gerontological presumptions, it might quite possibly be that we carry out research work and care that, in certain cases, are incompatible with the metatheoretical paradigm that defines reality for aging individuals in the real world. Perhaps we force upon some elderly people a paradigm that they, themselves, no longer inhabit.",57,Elderly,1.0
"Of course, it is not easy to free oneself from the paradigm that one is used to and to change the metatheoretical conditions for the scientific work. Just to discern the borders of the paradigm one is working within can be as difficult as it is for a fish to become conscious of the water in which it swims. Therefore, we cannot claim to be able to offer the new “quantum theory” of gerontology. The theory of gerotranscendence is, however, an attempt to renew some of the traditional ways of thinking while working within the framework of the above principles for breaking theoretical boundaries.",0,Gerontology,1.0
Origin of the Theory and First Outline,14,Theory,0.5413861783287021
"he theory of gerotranscendence was, as described in the previous chapter, born of the uncomfortable knowledge and insight that not only much of the empirical data didn’t match the prevailing",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"When Cumming, Newell, Dean, and McCaffrey (1960) first pub- lished their tentative disengagement theory of aging, followed by an elaboration (Cumming & Henry, 1961), the theoretical gerontological discussions turned into something like a riot. The theory assumed an intrinsic tendency to disengage and withdraw when growing old, which was supposed to go hand in hand with the tendency of society to reject aging individuals. The individual was, according to the theory, supposed to gradually cut his/her bonds with society and, to an increasing extent, turn inward. This two-way process was supposed to be, both for the individual and society, inevitable and functional. As a preparation for death, the individual and society were thought to gradually disengage from each other. This disengagement does not, according to the theory, involve dissatisfaction or mental problems on the part of the individual. On the contrary, since disengagement was supposed to be a natural process, it was associated with satisfaction and inner harmony. According to this theory, disengagement is a culture-free concept, but its specific expressions are invariably culture bound.",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
31,19,155,1.0
"In principle, the disengagement theory generated three types of hypotheses. The first hypothesis states that all societies, in one way or the other, push the aging individual away. The second hypothesis states that the individual, motivated by intrinsic forces, disengages from society. This individual disengagement is both social and psychological. Social disengagement refers to the reduction of social interaction and the reduc- tion of social roles and the amount of time spent in each role. Psychological disengagement refers to the reduction of ego involvement, interest, and emotional involvement in other people and society as such and, in its place, a disengaged turning inwards. The third hypothesis assumes that the individual, despite social and psychological disengagement, continues to experience a high degree of life satisfaction, happiness, and content- edness. This third hypothesis also implies indirectly a decrease in satisfac- tion if the natural process of disengagement is violated and old people are forced into various activities. Thus, the main premise of the activity theory—that activity leads to satisfaction and contentment—was disputed by the disengagement theory.",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"The disengagement theory not only ran counter to the widely ac- cepted activity theory, but also to the personal values held by many gerontologists, and their wishes for what reality ought to be like—a continuation of their middle-aged, middle-class Western lifestyle. And, additionally, as many gerontologists enter the field of gerontology with a mixed humanistic and scientific approach—having the feeling that old people are treated badly and wanting to study this scientifically—it is not surprising that the theory of disengagement was perceived as threatening and uninviting. From a humanistic point of view, the very word disen- gagement has negative overtones. Consequently, much time and effort were spent during the 1960s and 1970s to refute or modify the theory theoretically and empirically. The author of this book indeed participated in this campaign.",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"A series of modifying or alternative explanations to the empirically observable pattern of disengagement was offered. The theory in its origi- nal raw shape was apparently unacceptable. As the empirical data neither supported, nor totally refuted the theory (which was also the problem with the theory of activity), the theory could be disarmed by modification. Cumming (1963) herself modified the theory by stating that the process of disengagement is not universal but dependent on personality types.",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
All three hypotheses mentioned above have been the target of re- search for many gerontologists. Everyone seems to agree with the state-,0,Gerontology,1.0
"ment that Western societies reject old people. This agreement is also the only indisputable support for the disengagement theory. The second hypothesis, which states that the individual disengages socially and psycho- logically, has been dismissed by almost every gerontologist. Most geron- tologists, including the author of this book, agreed that individual disengagement was non-existent, and even if some “disengagement behav- ior” existed, it was dependent on something other than an intrinsic drive to disengage (Desroches & Kaiman, 1964; Videbeck & Knox, 1965; Kap- nick, et al., 1968; Palmore, 1968; Thomae, 1969; Tornstam, 1973).",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"Many gerontologists have been particularly interested in testing the third hypothesis and focusing the causes of life satisfaction and content- ment in old age—activity, disengagement, or something else. Lowenthal and Boler (1965) argued, for example, that the lack of sufficient support for the hypothesis that activity leads to well-being and contentment must be understood in terms of deprivation. A voluntary reduction of the social network and social engagement differs from an involuntary reduction. Havens (1968), on the other hand, gave prominence to the continuity of life patterns as the cause of life satisfaction and contentment in old age; the important thing is neither activity nor disengagement, but continuity. Tissue (1971) presented ideas similar to those of Lowenthal. The cause of dissatisfaction is the discrepancy between the social network the individ- ual has and the one he/she would like to have. Lowenthal and Haven (1968) pointed to the fact that the research usually fails to distinguish between the quantitative and qualitative aspects of social interaction. If we only measure the quantity of social interaction we end up with weak correlations between interaction and satisfaction.",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"Finally, social gerontology was supplied with a new model which completely reduced the disengagement pattern to social psychology. Kuypers and Bengtson (1973) took their point of departure from a model formulated by Zusman (1966) and introduced the concept of a social breakdown syndrome. Zusman’s model described the process by which the individual’s social environment interacts with his/her self-perception in the production of a negative spiral—a social breakdown. Kuypers and Bengtson transferred the model to social gerontology and presented at the same time a model of social reconstruction, which described how the negative disengagement pattern could be broken. If some kind of “disengagement behavior” could be observed, it was the result of an externally produced social breakdown spiral, which, by proper means,",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
could and should be reverted. The original disengagement theory had now been given the coup de grace.,2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"After this, the disengagement theory was referred to almost with disdain. Hardly any gerontologist dared to state anything but that the theory was false. The defeating of the disengagement theory was buoyed by an almost “religious” conviction of its incorrectness. This emotional vindication of the incorrectness of the theory resembles other “isms” (Communism, Protestantism, racism, etc.) where, after some time, devo- tion to the ism veils the reality. This possibility contributed to a curiosity to take a new look at the theory—with a new metatheoretical perspec- tive—to see if the outcome might throw some light on the aforementioned discrepancies between gerontological theory and empirical findings.",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"This curiosity was sustained by some indicators suggesting that cer- tain theoretical aspects might have been hidden in the shadow of the disengagement theory. One such “unscientific” indication was a personal conversation with the Polish gerontologist, Jerzy Piotrowski, with whom the author of this book had the pleasure of collaborating during a research period in Warsaw in 1975. While discussing with him the disengagement theory and its countertheories, we were both of the opinion that the disengagement theory was incorrect. Our discussion was renewed at the 11th International Congress of Gerontology in Tokyo in 1978. On this occasion Piotrowski suggested that the disengagement theory perhaps did trail some theoretical strength behind it after all. Maybe we had thrown the baby out with the bath water was Piotrowski’s suggestion. When asked what new evidence could be presented to support this opinion, Jerzy stated, “The evidence comes from within myself.”",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"Other indications came from subjective reports of staff members working with old people. On several occasions they reported having very mixed feelings when trying to “activate” certain old people. They main- tained that activity is good, but they nevertheless confessed feeling that they were doing something wrong when they tried to drag certain old people to various forms of arranged social activity or activity therapy. They felt as if they were trespassing on something they rather ought to respect and leave alone.",4,Depression,0.7138929990925386
"Even other, more “solid” indications, as mentioned earlier, contrib- uted to the suggestion that the disengagement theory perhaps did trail- shadow some theoretical strength behind it. In particular, it was at that time, my personal study of experiences of loneliness among Swedish inhabitants age 15 to 80 years (Tornstam, 1988) where it was shown,",33,Loneliness,1.0
"contrary to general assumptions, that the degree of loneliness decreased with every consecutive age group, despite their role losses and other losses. It was the young respondents, not the old ones, who reported the highest degrees of loneliness. It was also shown that the positive effect of social interaction with other people, as a remedy for loneliness, de- creased for every consecutive age group.",33,Loneliness,0.9909699754709111
THE PARADIGMATIC CONTEXT OF THE DISENGAGEMENT THEORY AND ITS COUNTER-THEORIES,2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"Although the old disengagement theory and its counter theories seem to be very different, they flourish within the same paradigmatic framework. This framework is a rather common positivist one, in which the individual is regarded as an object directed by internal and external forces and the researcher is mainly interested in the behavior of the individual. It is also the researcher who defines the key concepts and what is considered “normal.”",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"Also typical for these kinds of theories is the assumption of a common and shared definition of reality and the existence of general invariances or “laws”—sometimes qualified a bit by, for example, describing how the disengagement process can be slightly different for people with differ- ent personalities.",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"What was missing in order to make both disengagement theory as well as the theory of activity correspond with the empirical reality was the lever of a paradigmatic shift. To illustrate the point and in order to open the mind for doing something similar in gerontological theory, we will use two well-known and clear examples from other fields.",2,Dissatisfaction,1.0
"Everybody is familiar with the classic psychological double picture, in which you see either two faces turning toward each other—or a chalice. Depending on one’s perspective, one or the other of the pictures appears. What is background in one of the versions becomes foreground in the other. When the observation paradigm is changed in this way, the picture of the reality under observation also changes. In science there are many examples of how the picture of reality was modified when the theoretical paradigm was changed. The classic example of the importance such a change can bring is when the Ptolemaic cosmology was substituted with the Copernican system, as earlier described. When Copernicus suggested that the Earth and the other planets were in orbit around the sun, his",25,Postulate,0.20955510282984657
postulate was nothing less than a revolutionary shift of paradigm. Not only the picture of the cosmic system but all scientific theories were changed by this shift.,25,Postulate,0.31382209383947823
"In a much more modest way, such a paradigmatic shift is necessary for a new theoretical understanding of aging. A few gerontologists have in fact approached such a shift. Hochschild (1976), for example, argued that the patterns of “engagement” or “disengagement” must be phenome- nologically understood. What is lacking when it concerns the disen- gagement pattern is an understanding of the meaning the individual imparts to “engagement” or “disengagement”—not the meaning the ger- ontologist attributes to it.",2,Dissatisfaction,0.8237034203980491
"Gutmann (1976) did, in fact, move towards such a phenomenological description of the “disengagement pattern.” In a cross-cultural study of Americans, Navajo Indians, low- and highland Maya Indians, and Druzes, TAT-tests of young and old men were compared. The TAT is a projective test, where ambiguous drawings are shown, and the tested person asked to tell what is going on in the drawing. When telling this, the person projects his or hers own values, expectations, and definitions of reality into the picture.",2,Dissatisfaction,0.6479490311505772
"Gutmann found a common pattern in all societies: young men dem- onstrated what was called active mastery in their projections of the TAT- pictures, while the old men demonstrated passive mastery or magical mastery. For example, young men projected more competitiveness and aggressive- ness into the pictures, while old men projected more solidarity, under- standing, and harmony.",130,Gutmann,1.0
"At the same time as Gutmann observed this cross-cultural tendency toward passive mastery and magical mastery in old men, he also observed that this tendency was socially anchored among the Druze, but not among Americans. In the Druze culture the tendency toward passive mastery and magical mastery were found to be connected with leadership, activity, and engagement. In America the same tendencies were connected with social inactivity. In conclusion Gutmann summarized:",130,Gutmann,0.693580532040412
". . . it is the movement toward passive and magical mastery that appears to be universal, not the movement toward disengagement.",130,Gutmann,1.0
Gutmann was moving toward a paradigmatic shift but ultimately stopped himself by creating a dichotomy between disengagement and the universal tendencies of passive and magical mastery. His perspective,130,Gutmann,1.0
"remained traditional, since the behavior of the individual also was interpre- ted as a functional instrument for mastering a new situation. The behavior was seen as a coping strategy—not as a developmental qualitative differ- ence in how young and old men define reality.

EXPERIMENTAL THINKING WITH AN ALTERNATE METATHEORETICAL PARADIGM,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"To find way to a new meta-theoretical paradigm we shall leave the ordinary positivist way of thinking and instead, as an intellectual experiment, turn to the exotic and strange frame of reference offered by Eastern philosophy. We are going to contrast our understanding of the world with what a Zen Buddhist would probably have. This does not in any way mean the advocating of Zen Buddhism as misunderstood by some (e.g., Jo¨ nsson & Magnusson, 2001). It is just an example of turning our ordinary way of thinking upside down in order to get a new view of things—a technique suggested earlier in this book. So, the following is experimental thinking, based on guesses of how Zen Buddhists possibly might construct their world.",54,Zen,0.17793216098968315
"The Zen Buddhist probably lives within a cosmic world paradigm where many boundaries are diffuse and permeable. He probably looks upon Westerners as limited and trapped in an obsessive, materialistic pattern. When we, with our metatheoretical perspective, observe the Zen Buddhist lost in meditation, it is not unlikely that we end up labeling him as “disengaged.” We would almost certainly do so if we did not know that he was a Zen Buddhist.",54,Zen,1.0
"According to the metaperspective held by Zen Buddhists, however, it is not at all a matter of disengagement. The Zen Buddhist lives in a world that is defined differently from ours. In this world much of the difference between subject and object is erased. The statements made by a Zen Buddhist are often difficult to understand from the point of view of our metatheoretical paradigm—for example, that you and I not are separate objects but parts of the same entirety. Past, present, and future are not separate but exist simultaneously.",54,Zen,1.0
"It should be mentioned that this way of thinking is not totally foreign to Western philosophy—even if it has been virtually nonexistent within gerontology. In his theories of psychology, C. G. Jung (1953) described",55,Meditation,1.0
"the collective unconscious, referring to the fact that in our minds we have inherited predispositions that are reflections of the experiences of earlier generations. The collective unconscious embraces structures and predis- positions that unify both generations and individuals. There are no bound- aries between individuals, generations, or places. Some of Jung’s followers believe that you can get in touch with this collective unconscious through meditation. Much of the initial train of thought regarding gerotranscen- dence did, in fact, arise from an early lecture of Jung (1930), where he stated that the meaning and the tasks of old age are quite different from the meaning and the tasks of mid-life. In the first part of life the task is getting acquainted with and socialized to society, whereas the task in old age is getting acquainted with yourself and with the collective unconscious. Much of this can be understood as a transcendental change in the defini- tions of reality. In modern language a de- and re-construction of the reality—much in line with what might be regarded as strange and odd with a Zen Buddhist. In his 1930 lecture Jung also stated that is a tragedy in our part of the world that the developmental tasks of the second half of life seem unknown to most people. We lead our lives with the erroneous apprehension that continuing with the tasks of the first half of life is all there is. As a consequence many of us meet our death as only half- developed individuals, exhibiting signs of depression, despair, fear of death, and disgust with ourselves and others, together with a feeling that life has been uncompleted or wasted. Jung’s lecture implies that other (non-Western) cultures might be better aware of the special develop- mental tasks of the second half of life.",55,Meditation,0.37584079907351386
"At any rate, here we can find a link between Eastern and Western philosophy. Erich Fromm (1960) points to other links between Western psychiatry and Zen Buddhism. We mention this since venturing into a foreign, strange metaworld might feel safer if we can hold hands with a couple of well-known Western philosophers.",54,Zen,0.09160067597424629
"However, the Zen Buddhist would probably never agree to being labeled as “disengaged.” Rather, he would call himself transcendent in the sense that he lives in another, more boundary-free world compared with most of us from Western societies. His engagement is substantial, but according to a definition other than ours. That is why we might reach the conclusion that before our very eyes we have an individual who is ignorant of the world and disengaged.",54,Zen,1.0
"Now, let us suppose that, without thinking about it, we become more and more like the Zen Buddhist, figuratively speaking, when we age.",54,Zen,0.26427534906617944
"Suppose that, without knowing anything about Zen Buddhism or tran- scendence, we reach a certain degree of transcendence. Some of us might even reach a high degree of transcendence—entering a new metaworld with new definitions of reality. These definitions might seem to be much less restricted than the “normal” definitions held by social gerontologists. Then we would end up with a remarkable situation in which researchers with one paradigm try to study individuals who are living according to another one—just as if Ptolemy, working from his paradigm, should try to describe and interpret the theories of Copernicus.",54,Zen,0.12085853220010624
"Let’s suggest that aging, or rather living, implies a process during which the degree of transcendence increases from young adulthood and on. If looking at the full age range we might even find a U-shaped correlation with age. As small children we live in a world with a higher degree of transcendence, where the borders between you and me, now and then, fantasy and reality, are permeable. Gradually these borders are established according to the rules and definitions given by our culture. Later on, in young adulthood, these borders again become permeable and the degree of transcendence increases. The kind of transcendence we experience as small children could be termed paedotranscendence as distinguished from the gerotranscendence we can reach in old age. This, however, in no way implies that gerotranscendence means returning to childhood. Instead, we suggest that the condition of gerotranscendence is reached by a process where all the experiences in earlier life are included. Therefore, at the same time we suggest that the process towards gerotrans- cendence is generated by normal living. Let’s also suggest that this process is intrinsic and culture free, but modified by specific cultural patterns.",37,Gerotranscendence,0.6786070309696002
"In principle, it might be assumed that the process towards gerotrans- cendence, after young adulthood, is a life-long and continuous one. In practice, however, this process might be both obstructed and accelerated. The process toward gerotranscendence might, for example, be accelerated by a life crisis, after which the individual totally restructures his/her metaworld instead of resigning him/herself to the former one. This accel- erated restructuring of the metaworld has been described in many cases of young individuals facing death as a result of a fatal disease. It should be emphasized that, in our interpretation, this is not the same as a defense mechanism, which always functions within the former metaworld. As we see it, both the classic defense mechanisms and the processes of coping take place within a given metatheoretical framework, whereas gerotrans- cendence refers to a shift away from this framework.",102,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"It is presumed that the process toward gerotranscendence also can be impeded. It is most probable that certain elements in our culture, for example, hinder this process. Social gerontologists themselves might contribute to its obstruction. We shall return to this question later. If we, however, accept the idea that the process towards gerotranscendence can be both obstructed and accelerated, we will as a consequence find many different degrees of gerotranscendence in old people. Not everyone will automatically reach a high degree of gerotranscendence. It is rather expected to be a process, which, at very best, culminates in a new gerotrans- cendent perspective.",21,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"The idea of a life process which optimally ends with gerotranscen- dence recalls the developmental model formulated by Erik H. Erikson (1950, 1982). According to this model the individual develops through seven stages and, if all goes well, ends up in an eighth stage, which Erikson calls ego-integrity. At this stage the individual reaches a fundamental accep- tance of his/her own life—regardless of how good or bad it has been. The individual looks back and feels satisfied with the past. Erikson’s eighth stage and what is referred to as the stage of gerotranscendence differ on this point. In their interviews with Gutmann (1976) the old Druze males, who by our terms had reached the stage of gerotranscendence, did not look back on their past lives with pure satisfaction. Rather, they considered themselves as ignorant when they lived in the former meta- world and were reluctant to look back at this immature period in life with proud satisfaction only.",28,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"According to Erikson’s theory, if the individual does not reach the eighth stage of ego-integrity, he/she experiences despair and fear of death. The positive personality characteristic during this eighth stage is wisdom, while its negative opposite is disgust and contempt. The individual who reaches this eighth stage also recognizes ego-integrity in others who have come to the same destination. Erikson is, however, rather vague when describing what the wisdom in this eighth stage really constitutes. It may be that Erikson, as do others who talk vaguely about wisdom, intuitively have come close to what here is referred to as gerotranscendence—without understanding the metatheoretical shift of paradigm that is necessary in order to reach a new comprehension, as suggested by the experimental thinking on gerotranscendence.",28,Gerotranscendence,1.0

"The change in the perception of objects might include an elimination of the boundaries between “you” and “me” and between “us” and “them.” An impression of being “one” might perhaps appear instead. As a conse- quence, the degree of self-centeredness would probably diminish. To a certain extent the enclosed self may become disaggregated and substituted with a cosmic self. Individuals might no longer look upon themselves as especially important. Maybe they perceive themselves as part of a cosmic flow of energy, in which the flow of energy, and not its individual parts, is the important thing. This might also involve a redefinition of the perception of life and death. It is not individual life but rather the total",86,Touch,1.0
"flow of life that is important. With such changes in the definitions of the metaworld it would be understandable that the fear of death would de- crease and that the feeling of affinity with past, present, and coming generations would increase.",73,Fear,0.6737010802316634
"With the above assumed changes in the definitions of the world, it is easy to predict a decreasing interest in superfluous social relations and material goods. The individual who has experienced these changes may look with pity on many younger people who are obsessed with social engagements. Instead, time might be spent on what is more important, e.g., meditation and philosophizing. This does not necessarily imply a social withdrawal, although that may prove to be the case in our society, as suggested by Gutmann (1976), since few roles conforming to gerotrans- cendence are provided and no guidance for entering the later part of life is given.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"It is interesting how Chinen (1985, 1986), in an analysis of fairy tales which include older protagonists, found that the central motif in these tales is transcendence. Chinen proposed that the fairy tales represent guidelines for the developmental sequence of old age and identified pro- cesses of religious, social, and psychological transcendence. After re- viewing over 2500 fairy tales, Chinen found that very few from Western societies had an older protagonist. Instead, the Western fairy tales pre- dominantly featured young protagonists. In Eastern and some Slavic coun- tries there seem to be normative fairy tales supporting the process towards gerotranscendence, while in the Western countries no such phenomenon can be observed. Drawing on this finding, we suggest that the stress on youth in the Western fairy tales, as well as in society as such, may obstruct the process towards gerotranscendence—simply by overshadowing the developmental tasks of old age. The existence of such tasks becomes invisible.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Chinen (1989a) also provided an example of how the new insights of old age can be achieved, under favorable circumstances, through a gradual process of change. Chinen analyzed the changing attitudes to- wards their science of two outstanding scientists, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alfred North Whitehead, both still active and respected scientists and philosophers in their old age. Both of them changed their view of science from a rather rigid and self-assured positivism in their younger years, to a more pragmatic attitude in mid-life, and finally to a transcen- dent outlook in their old age. In their younger years, they were sure about things and convinced that, given sufficient research, everything could be",84,Scientists,1.0
"given scientific explanation. In mid-life, they began to accept the thought that possibly everything may not be explainable in scientific terms. And, in their old age, both evidenced a radical transcendence of the borderlines between scientific disciplines as well as an acceptance of nonscientific explanations. To Chinen’s observation it could be added that there are other examples of well known scientists who have developed in a similar way, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr, to name a few.",84,Scientists,0.5942899944520184

Chinen (1989a) holds that this development is seen in individuals who either are given the chance or have within them the power to develop freely. Many of us, however, meet obstacles to such a free development.",84,Scientists,1.0
OBSTRUCTIONS IN THE PROCESS TOWARDS GEROTRANSCENDENCE,3,Gerotranscendence,0.8950907362820977
"In Western culture we might possibly be at risk of being regarded as odd, asocial, mentally disturbed or even disengaged if we change our perceptions of the world in accordance with a gerotranscendental develop- ment. In most Western cultures there are no roles or arenas where such a view of reality fits. In the Druze world, however, as described by Gutmann (1976), there were roles and arenas available within, for example, religion and religious ceremonies provided a social arena for the wise chiefs and shamans.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Everyone in Western culture “knows” that it is activity, productivity, efficiency, individuality, independency, wealth, health, sociability, and a “realistic” view of the world that counts. By considering this as “fact,” we are making a moral and normative judgment. As a result, we may impede the process towards gerotranscendence by making the individual feel guilty about his/her developmental change away from parts of this. Supported by interactionist gerontologists, staff members and relatives of old people may obstruct a natural process towards gerotranscendence. The attitude is that old people who are “turning inwards” or “withdraw- ing” to something we do not understand, must be reactivated. Inevitably, even old people participate in this obstruction as they, like everyone else,",21,Gerotranscendence,1.0

We should therefore not be surprised to find old people who feel guilt in connection with their own development toward gerotranscendence; they may even apologize for having reached a different view of life and living.",21,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"One hypothesis is that, paradoxically, obstruction of the gerotrans- cendental process may possibly precipitate a real syndrome of social break- down. Hindered in their own personal development, and assaulted by feelings of guilt, individuals may regress to a former developmental stage and undergo a syndrome of social breakdown. This is very much in line with Jung’s sad observation that lots of people in our society grow old unknowing of the special developmental tasks of later life, and thereby come to develop depression, despair, fear of death, disgust with themselves and others, together with the feeling that life has been wasted.",70,Gerotranscendence,0.8888168240814434
"The works of several of the scholars quoted above (Jung, Hochschild, Gutmann, Erikson, Chinen) point in a vague way towards a developmental process which, by and large, has been neglected by gerontologists. Other indirect evidence for the claim that gerotranscendence is part of a normal process is suggested by Peck (1956, 1968). In a study of approximately one thousand businessmen he focused on developmental crises during middle and old age.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Peck’s description of how these subjects deal with aging implies a right or good way in the sense that this way seemed connected with more happiness and life satisfaction in old age. In line with Erikson (1950) he pointed to a number of developmental crises that may result in either a positive constructive outcome or a negative one. He did not, however, say much about the general developmental process behind the different ways of handling the crises in the second half of life.",119,Book,1.0

"Ego differentiation or job preoccupation. Some people seem to be able to reorient their lives in such a way that their identity is no longer dependent on the previous work role. Many other things replace the importance the job had earlier in relation to the perception of the self. Others seem unable to let go of their earlier work career. Ego differentiation is regarded by Peck as the natural and good solution to this developmental crisis, but something prevents certain people from reaching this stage.",28,Gerotranscendence,0.6347120488479049

"are attuned to every little new ailment and make it a major problem in life. Others seem to transcend the body in the sense that they know all about their physical condition and take proper care, but are not focused on it as if it were the hub of universe. Peck indirectly states that body transcendence is the natural development, which for some reason is thwarted for many people.",96,Transcendence,0.03607707261424071
"Ego transcendence or ego preoccupation. In the same way as the body, the ego should be transcendent in old age. Peck claims that the knowledge of one’s own aging and the inevitability of death should prompt a reorganization of the ego, causing the elderly to live in a more generous, unselfish way. This should induce an acceptance of death. For various reasons, many people seem unable to reach such a stage. Instead they develop the type of ego preoccupation and fear of death described by Erikson as despair.",28,Gerotranscendence,0.4140450301536596
"When Peck (1956) uses the term transcendence he means something like “overcoming” pains of the body or fear of death and the future, an adaptation to or coping with a deteriorating life situation. Our interpreta- tion is, again, that what Peck actually found were aspects of the general process towards gerotranscendence, which in our society is obstructed by our value patterns and notions of how life in old age should be. We suggest that the “good choices” cited above are reflections of a successful gerotranscendental process. Behind the bad choices are obstructions in the process of gerotranscendence.",119,Book,0.9693378638909216
CONCLUSION,15,Conclusions,0.6857256238417001
"In this chapter we have suggested that human nature—the very process of living—encompasses a general tendency toward gerotranscendence, which is, in principle, universal and culture free. To reach gerotranscen- dence might be to reach wisdom. Our hypothesis is that the process toward gerotranscendence is continuous, but can be either accelerated or obstructed. If all goes well, we will reach the final stage of gerotranscen- dence, but much in our society impedes the process. In Western societies the process toward gerotranscendence might often be accompanied by guilt. It may be that social gerontologists contribute to such an obstruc- tion, for example, by misinterpreting gerotranscendence as negative disen- gagement. From our perspective, however, gerotranscendence is never negative. It could instead be the highest level of human development and,",21,Gerotranscendence,0.9126187923136956
"as such, supremely positive. Of course this statement contains a normative component—an idea of what natural and good personal development should be like. In this respect our theory is no different from others, for example, the theory of activity or Erikson’s developmental theory. But, it is different, and it offers a new understanding of aging.",119,Book,1.0
"Different and seemingly conflicting theories can very well be valid at the same time. It is, for example, true that light can be described both as “particles” and as “waves.” Both these perceptions of light are true, based on different scientific paradigms. In the same way, the suggested theory of gerotranscendence can be true at the same time as the activity theory. The latter is true within its own metatheoretical paradigm. In other words, we do not deny the applicability of other theories. They are valid and applicable to individuals who have the same view of life as the theories. They are, however, less applicable to individuals who have moved on to a new comprehension of life—a new metaworld.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"This leads us to a major challenge for future empirical and practical gerontology—how to decide whether an individual is demonstrating a negative withdrawal within the mid-life metaworld, or is in the process of transforming this metaworld into a new one, in the process toward gerotranscendence. The very first and most important step is, of course, to recognize if there is something called gerotranscendence. The next step is to discover its characteristics.",117,Gerotranscendence,0.7581041050420638
"As in Jung’s theory of the individuation process, gerotranscendence is regarded as a possible final stage in a natural progression towards maturation and wisdom. It defines a reality somewhat different from the “normal,” mid-life reality which we often tend to project on old age. Even if Bernice Neugarten and colleagues (1964) early on wrote about the contemplative nature of the inner lives of old people and Clark and Anderson (1967) described how older people turn away from the competi- tive values of mid-life, many theories have, as earlier described, been based on the assumption that “good aging” equals continuity and preserv- ing mid-life ideals, activities, and definitions of reality. The theory of gerotranscendence takes a perspective that emphasizes change and development.",21,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"The term gerotranscendence has been chosen because many of the related changes, crises, or developmental characteristics described by oth- ers involve various ways in which elderly people break through old bound- aries or transcend developmental crises when moving on to a new stage",22,Gerotranscendence,0.4836165146489628

"The outcome is based on in-depth interviews with 50 people recruited after a lecture on some early tentative ideas about the theory—basically corresponding to the content of the previous chapter in this book.

The analysis as well as the following presentation are organized in terms of some major categories obtained during the open-theme interviews.

"It is interesting to note that Achenbaum and Orwoll (1991) have reached similar dimensions in a psychogerontological analysis of The Book of Job.

"Among the 50 respondents, some two or three, as exceptions, came to the lecture and agreed to be interviewed, not because they had experienced any development towards gerotranscendence, but because they felt that the developmental idea was interesting even if they could not identify any such change in themselves.

In the following, then, a contrast is made between a respondent who",111,Gerotranscendence,0.7377301531984826

Separating body and mind has almost become the norm for the aging human being as well as for the gerontologist. In her book The Ageless self, Kaufman (1986) has introduced this separation between body and mind as part of the normal aging process. The self does not age, only the body. In this perspective, then, Eva’s aging is not “normal.” For Eva, changes occur in both body and mind. There is a self-developing in an aging body. Eva not only accepts, but enjoys, this development.

They say that, in early life and adulthood, they had a very clear idea of what is today and what belongs to yesterday, but that it has changed and they feel like they are able to be in two time periods at once. Their past may be present so strongly that they almost live in it, at the same time as they live in the present. Is this something that you recognize?",136,Transcended,1.0
"A few of the respondents answered “yes” to the specific question, but the majority slid over to reports on how childhood has come more alive in their older days.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"The fact that people, irrespective of any transcendence of time, begin to think more about childhood experiences and places is well illustrated by the 86-year-old woman who said:",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"You go back to childhood almost daily. It comes without reflection. I talked to a good friend about this . . . We both go back to the town where we grew up [in our thoughts] . . . Childhood means much more than one thinks, I go back to it all the time.",64,Childhood,0.5047686868482488
A 79-year-old woman expressed a similar view saying that it both pleases and scares her: “Now I’m almost 80 and now I dare to remember my childhood.” She added:,163,Childhood,1.0
"The older you get, the more you remember of your childhood. There’s a dangerous trap in this. I have heard about that all my life.",163,Childhood,0.9836415916591142
"Thus, when she realized that recalling the experiences of childhood was beginning to mean a lot to her, she became frightened. She interpreted it as a negative sign of her own aging. She had not come up with this negative interpretation herself. She said: “I have heard about that all my life.” Thus, the pleasure that this woman finds in recalling her childhood is offset by the negative interpretation of returning to childhood that she has internalized.",163,Childhood,1.0
The Connection to Earlier Generations,58,Transcended,1.0
"The descriptions of transcendence of the time dimension and the impor- tance of childhood in several cases drifted over to another theme, namely the relation to earlier generations of people. A 72-year-old man describes how the distance to the 17th century has decreased:",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"If we take the 17th century, it used to be (earlier, in my younger years) tremendously distant, but today I don’t think that the 17th century is all that far away. It is somehow as if it has come nearer. And everything in history has come nearer.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"We also recall that Eva perceived “the coiling genetic chain” as her immortality. In both these cases, the feeling of kinship and affinity with earlier generations has been expressed in more general terms. In one case as a general kinship with previously living people, in the other case as a definition of immortality.",34,Immortality,1.0
In the interview the interviewer introduced the theme in a way that more directly related to the respondents’ own ancestors:,101,Kinship,0.9240331697250127
"Some people say that, during the course of life, they experienced a change in how they feel in relation to their ancestors. It’s a kind of increasing kinship with those who lived earlier, a feeling that you are a link in the chain of generations. Have you experienced this?",101,Kinship,0.9816080803850848
"This theme provoked many reactions in the respondents. The most promi- nent was the many reports about the wakening interest in genealogy. Several respondents had begun to seek their roots in this tangible manner. When describing their feelings of increased kinship with earlier gen- erations, respondents used expressions or metaphors showing that the kinship with ancestors has a very strong appeal. “It’s the desire under the elms, you know,” said a 65-year-old woman referring to an old movie classic.5 “Yes, yes, it is almost a religious feeling,” said a 71-year-old man.",101,Kinship,1.0
Life and Death,73,Fear,0.4564906759609072
The theme concerning life and death was introduced in the following way:,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
Some people experience changes during life in relation to the questions of life and death. Somebody who has feared death in his or her youth can get rid of the fear later in life. Others have always feared death. How do you feel about this?,95,Fear,0.9070171927691756
"There were various types of reactions to this question, but the common denominator was that the respondents did not, in general, fear death. They may fear dying, that it will be extended and painful, but not being dead. Some have had this feeling all their lives while others have achieved it later in life.",95,Fear,1.0
A 58-year-old man formulated an attitude that comes back in sev- eral interviews:,4,Depression,1.0
". . . much of life may be preparation for dying. It is in the character of maturation. I think it comes completely by itself. I don’t live in order to die, I want to live. But implicit in maturation is a greater and greater capacity for dying. Some kind of preparation. I think that eventually one dies quite naturally.",157,Dying,1.0
"This attitude, and consequently a decreasing fear of death, had come gradually during life. A couple of respondents describe a more sudden disappearance of the fear of death in connection with “near death experiences.”",95,Fear,1.0
"Irrespective of how people have come to terms with death, our interviews indicate the great importance this seems to have for gerotrans- cendence and positive maturation in old age. None of the respondents who either feared death or avoided the question showed any signs of development towards gerotranscendence.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
Mystery in Life,100,Mystery,1.0
"This theme, focusing the acceptance of the mysteries of life, was intro- duced in the following way:",100,Mystery,0.66383132424084
"Some people say that they have come to accept that there are things in life that can not be explained with science or reason, things that must be left incomprehensible, part of the mystery of life. Do you recognize this?",100,Mystery,0.32787467699587713
Several respondents recognized this and many pointed out that it had been a gradual change during life. An 85-year-old woman said:,41,Gradual,0.9720345992466591
"I guess I have taken for granted [earlier] that science knows what it talks about. But now I have realized that there is an awful lot beyond the reach of human knowledge [and] especially senses, that we can’t know anything about.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
The same woman said that there may be “knowledge categories” that are quite different from those that we are used to.,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"A related thought was expressed by the 71-year-old man who thinks that what we can understand is limited by language. Language constrains us to a certain form of understanding, he says, and implies that tran- scending the barriers of language gives rise to new forms of understanding. He gives as examples music and painting, which may allow forms of understanding beyond those that can be expressed through language. This statement corresponds with Gamliel (2001) who observed that a group of people at a house for the elderly used to gather in silence before dinner:",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

Transcendental Sources of Happiness,24,Transcendence,1.0

". . . one is, of course, a little softer now than before in certain situations. Above all, pretty music. The tears flow almost, well, my eyes get moist at least. There are other situations, too, . . . like drama and music. It wasn’t like that before. But now it’s a block that’s breaking down . . . you experience it as a sort of euphoria, feeling of happiness. It has come during the last few years.",35,Music,0.4334403595824506
"Regarded superficially, it may seem as though the man has simply become more interested in music or just has become more soft-hearted. The real meaning of this new source of joy can go deeper, however. The respondent himself says that it is a block that is breaking down. His experience of music borders on something that has previously been sealed off. Now, however, this block is released.",35,Music,1.0
"When the interview touched upon the joys of life and how these may have changed, there were many answers that can be seen as related to the example above. The transcendent Eva and many others said that earlier it was the more spectacular events that gave joy in life, but that now it is more a question of small and commonplace things. These are often, as in the case of Eva, events and experiences in nature. Not that the opportunities for spectacular events have vanished, it is the perspec- tives that have changed.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Instead of assuming that such changes are adaptations to decreasing possibilities in life, one must accordingly ask whether the increasing inter- est in the small everyday experiences of nature does not have a deeper significance. A 58-year-old man describes what this may be about:",41,Gradual,1.0
"I see trees, buds, and I see it blossom, and I see how the leaves are coming—I see myself in the leaves.",131,Flower,1.0
"The experience of nature evokes the feeling of being at one with the universe, which is called at-one-ment in the Eastern tradition. The increas- ing significance of these small everyday experiences of nature could there-",16,Rejoicing,1.0
fore be interpreted as a way in which the barrier between the self and the universe is transcended.,150,Transcendence,1.0
"Almost all respondents who have children and grandchildren stressed their importance. This well-known phenomenon, too, can be given an interpretation in terms of the concept of transcendence. Through children and grandchildren the barriers between the present and the future as well as between life and death are transcended. “The coiling genetic chain” is present in the children and the grandchildren. This chain provides the opportunity to participate in life on earth in the future.",58,Transcended,0.1881149371278255
THE SELF DIMENSION GEROTRANSCENDENCE,62,Scales,1.0
"The first outline to the theory of gerotranscendence assumes that the individual self is gradually changing and developing. In this regard, the theory contrasts sharply with theories that assume that the self, like the perception of the self, is constant and ageless. In our interviews, we have approached the question of the constancy or variability of the self and the perception of the self in aging using several conversation themes.",37,Gerotranscendence,0.652374075775657
Self-Confrontation,40,Self,1.0
"The constancy of perception of the self is partly dependent on the degree to which we discover the hidden aspects of our personality, what Jung calls the shadow. This theme was introduced in the following way:",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Some people say that, during the course of life, they have begun to discover sides of themselves that they hadn’t known before, both positive and negative. Do you recognize any of this in yourself?",86,Touch,0.7921778338573966
"Our respondents reported that they had discovered both positive and negative sides of themselves in their older years. An 85-year-old respon- dent discovered a literary talent. It can also be a question of previously unknown personal characteristics. One respondent discovered that she is actually a cheerful, light-hearted person, while another respondent real- ized that she is more serious than she had once thought. Still another respondent said that what he had earlier considered positive carefulness in his personality was in fact an exaggerated pedantry.",42,Elderly,0.8006158206374118
The latter case is not about discovering new qualities in oneself but rather about redefining qualities that were already known. Another example,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"of this redefinition of qualities is given by a 72-year-old man, a former labor union ombudsman, who used to think that his driving force was engagement and empathy, but who now understands that it was pure performance anxiety that drove him.",4,Depression,0.9149306011101263
"The most common discovery or redefinition, however, is about rela- tionships to other people. Respondents described an egocentricity that they had previously been unconscious of.

"Considering the indoctrination of the people of this generation in Scandi- navia with the theses of the Jante Law (first thesis: Don’t think that you are important! [A.

Everyday Wisdom,32,Wisdom,1.0
It is often thought that practical everyday wisdom or common sense increases with age. This was the point of departure when the following theme was introduced:,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
Some people think that it has become easier and easier to make wise decisions and help others to make decisions. What is your experience of this?,99,Decisions,1.0
"A number of respondents answered in a way that makes one assumption in our question explicit, namely, that it is possible to distinguish between wise and unwise decisions. The respondents often reached the conclusion that it has become more difficult to identify the boundary between wise and unwise.",32,Wisdom,0.5534945734825005
"Given the experience that the boundaries between right and wrong, wise and unwise are transcended, the consequence for everyday wisdom is to refrain from giving advice or helping others to make decisions. The transcendent Eva said that what she had learned above all was to refrain from giving good advice. In a similar vein, an 80-year-old woman said:",32,Wisdom,0.5766176928300837
"I guess I used to think that I always made good decisions and gave good advice, too. I have been in a situation where I have had to give a lot of advice  I had no problems with it. How is it now? I guess I must",99,Decisions,1.0

"In summary, in these reports everyday wisdom is expressed by avoiding both giving good advice and helping people make decisions. The origin of this form of everyday wisdom is the transcendence of the boundary between right and wrong accompanied by an increased broadmindedness and tolerance.",32,Wisdom,1.0
OBSTACLES AND SHORTCUTS ON THE PATH TO GEROTRANSCENDENCE,3,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"Since, according to the theory, the development towards gerotranscen- dence can be obstructed as well as facilitated, it is reasonable to assume various catalysts and obstacles to be described in the interviews. This was also the case. These catalysts and obstacles are described in the following.",72,Gerotranscendental,0.593001673927446
Owning as a Burden,142,Owning,1.0
"One obstacle was identified in the above thematic survey—unnecessary material assets. Even if none of the respondents advocated pure asceticism, several spontaneously argued that owning too much may be burdensome and binding. Others, elaborating on the same theme, recommended that the latter part of the journey through life should be made with “light luggage.” In addition, there were descriptions of how this has been achieved by giving away a good deal of property and adopting a simpler life. A 60-year-old woman, who did just that, said:",143,Unpack,1.0
"I want to own as little property as I can. I have simple china, simple knives and spoons. I want it that way. I don’t want it the way it used to be. It’s great fun if the kids can use it  Some of it is packed up,",142,Owning,1.0
"I don’t want to unpack it. I think living simply is nice, but I wish I was living out in the country.",143,Unpack,1.0
"This quotation not only reflects a longing for comfortable simplicity— what we called earlier modern asceticism—but also a longing for the country life. The interview revealed that the attraction was the refreshing ascetic solitude near nature. This could be a side effect of the current “back to nature” trend, but we could just as well refer to parallels from other time periods and other cultures. In the Indian religion, since the ancient Vedic culture more than 3000 years ago, there have been ideas about how to live in order to achieve purification of the soul and eventual attainment of nirvana. Tilak (1989) describes how, during the Dharma Sastra period (200 B.C.–200 A.D.), life is explicitly organized in four phases, each with different content and meaning. These phases are: 1) the student, 2) the housekeeper, 3) the hermit, and 4) the wanderer. Characteristic of the latter two periods is the giving up of material goods. During the hermit phase, the old man, possibly accompanied by his wife, is expected to give up his house and lands, join other hermits in the woods and lead a simple life. During the last phase, the wanderer or beggar phase, he has given up all earthly goods and wanders alone from village to village.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
Tilak holds that the idea of these phases still remains in the normative,0,Gerontology,1.0
"cultural heritage in India. A modern version of the hermit phase, for example, may consist in an old man or woman periodically isolating himself or herself in a room to meditate. This behavior, thanks to the living cultural heritage, is neither misunderstood nor opposed.",55,Meditation,0.37584079907351386
"It must be understood that none of our interviewees aimed at anything like the extreme poverty and isolation described in the old Vedic tradition. Rather they wanted to live a modern, comfortable, but simple life, under- standing the trap inherent in excessive owning.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
Positive Solitude,6,Solitude,1.0
"The modern asceticism described above also contains a prominent element of what we call positive solitude. The need for and the pleasure of contempla- tive solitude are evident in most of our interviews. There are at least two reasons for this. One reason is that solitude seems to be necessary in order to achieve and consolidate one’s ego-integrity. The other reason is that one has become more selective in terms of activities and social interactions. The man who preferred to read a book or listen to a record expressed part of these two aspects at the same time. While he experienced social interaction with certain other people as tiresome and meaningless, there was also a new need for the joy and stimulation offered by soli- tary activities.",6,Solitude,0.5837920755349325
"The need and search for positive solitude is not the same as ultimately choosing loneliness over interaction with others. Rather, the need for positive solitude comes and goes. A woman said:",6,Solitude,0.6295223402855826
"I need periods of solitude, then it feels good to work things out and maybe change my behavior. And I feel that those periods make me feel well and that I need them. Other people can’t understand that perhaps.",6,Solitude,1.0
"This woman eventually touches on a question which is not unessential, namely other people’s lack of understanding of the importance of positive solitude. The Swedish language lacks a cognate of the primarily positive English word solitude. This may be a further reason why the positive need for solitude may be misinterpreted in terms of negative disengagement, depression, apathy or resignation. Of course, this kind of loneliness exists, too. It has been exemplified by Greta who appears to have stopped in her development towards gerotranscendence. The point is that we probably misinterpret some people’s need for a positive solitude as signs of depres- sion or negative withdrawal.",33,Loneliness,0.8766789114564265
Life Crises,75,Crises,1.0
The theoretical discussion of the concept of transcendence emphasizes the possible role of life crises as catalysts. Life crises may contain the kinetic energy that make the development towards gerotranscendence accelerate. Our interviews contain several examples in which crises have contrib- uted to an accelerated development towards gerotranscendence. An 80- year-old woman described how the death of a close friend a couple of,43,Crises,0.37130930145907187
years ago had changed her and helped her to develop:,112,Eva,0.9929840401063715
"I guess I was a noli me tangere type. This means “don’t touch me.” . . .

"A 68-year-old man told us, in a similar way, about how his heart disease and operation opened him up to thoughts that he had not had before. A book that would not have interested him before became the gateway to a process of change:",119,Book,0.9857841093816169
"I think there is so much in these new things that I have learned that makes things fall into place. You just lose the fear of death, and then there is so much to learn, and there is a lot to be done there . . . so I’m in the middle of a process where I have a lot to learn.",73,Fear,1.0
"The life crisis changed the direction of this man’s life not only through the power of the crisis itself, but also by preparing him for new thoughts and impressions. In this way, crises can be said to have a double effect.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"One way of understanding life crises in this context is that they consist of upheavals that challenge or question the foundations of one’s concept of reality. The death of a close relative, for example, undermines ideas of immortality, the notion that “it won’t happen to me,” and the idea that it is never too late to change. In scientific terminology, we would say that crises might challenge, question, and undermine basic ontological assumptions, replacing them with new ontological assumptions.",75,Crises,1.0
Bridges and Landings,13,Staff,0.17072400487232234
"Our respondents gave several examples of what could be called mediating links or bridges to different aspects of gerotranscendence. The transcen- dent Eva talked about how experiences of nature—swallows flying like arrows over her head, picking nettles for soup—give her life meaning. This can be understood both as part of her gerotranscendence and as a bridge to it. The development towards gerotranscendence seems to be stimulated by small experiences of nature. Also, the 59-year-old man’s ability to see himself in the leaves on the trees can be interpreted in the same way.",149,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"The transcendent quality of experiences of nature offers a new way of understanding the increased interest in nature and gardening expressed by many older people. Old people’s interest in their gardens is often interpreted in other ways, seen as a sort of therapy or a way to fill up their otherwise idle lives.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Apart from experiences of nature, our interview material also contains descriptions of experiences of music and drama as parts of or bridges to gerotranscendence. In the section on sources of happiness, a 77-year-old man related how experiences of music had become more important and more emotional for him. This statement can be interpreted in several ways. The man himself said that it was a barrier that had been broken down. In our terminology, we would say that it was the barrier between music and emotion that had been transcended, or that music helps in",35,Music,1.0
"transcending a number of barriers. Music becomes a bridge to a transcen- dent experience of the whole. In such an interpretation, the increased emotional element stands out as something positive, as an indication that certain barriers have been demolished. Using other frames of reference, the same report could be interpreted as pathological. The increasing emotionality, the softening up, becomes a symptom of a disintegrating personality. The latter interpretation is the most common in the gero- psychiatry literature.",35,Music,1.0
"However, if the experiences of nature and music are considered in parallel, certain similarities can be seen that clearly indicate their transcen- dental character. Both cases deal with experiences that appeal more to the emotions than to the intellect. The dimensions of experiences of both nature and music are relatively free. Their limits are set subjectively; they are not limited by predetermined categories. The relative freedom from boundaries, frames, and rules that characterize these experiences can thus become bridges to new ways of defining existential categories.",35,Music,0.2822039182845416

We should rather talk about it as a developmental possibility, where the precise form of the gerotrans- cendence can differ from individual to individual. Also, there are several pathways to gerotranscendence. It may be that the seed of gerotranscende- nce is within us all, but needs proper watering to grow. In today’s society, we probably lack much of the proper watering, which also means that the proportion of individuals who reach high degrees of gerotranscendence is quite small.",22,Gerotranscendence,0.6898896263296416

Some of the aspects of gerotranscendence, as summarized above, were recognized by most of the interviewees, while some were recognized by just a few.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"The need for and the pleasure of contemplative positive solitude is highly evident in our interviews. This call for positive solitude as described by our respondents is, however, not the same as loneliness and disen- gagement. Rather, it is part of a development wherein they have become more selective. This eventually touches on a question that is essential, namely, that the developmental changes described by our interviewees could be given different interpretations. One set of interpretations stems from traditional gerontological theories, while other interpretations are rooted in a different paradigm as offered by the theory of gero- transcendence.",6,Solitude,1.0
"The decreasing interest in participating in certain social and personal relationships could, from a traditional perspective, be regarded as a nega- tive disengagement, or as part of a social breakdown syndrome. But, at least among our respondents, the meaning of this behavior must be interpreted quite differently—as part of a positive developmental change. In the same vein, emancipated innocence could be regarded as a mental breakdown symptom, even though our interviews suggest it should be interpreted as part of a positive transcendence of futile social conventions. Our interviews show that these and other aspects of gerotranscen- dence form, for the individual, coherent developmental patterns, of which high degrees of life satisfaction and absence of depression and neurotic symptoms are parts. The conclusion must be that the traditional interpre- tations have a limited scope. Sometimes traditional interpretations of behaviors such as those mentioned above may be appropriate, sometimes they may be totally wrong.

"of gerotranscendence, might at times be more intelligible.",3,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"The developmental perspective in the theory of gerotranscendence is certainly very different from the old disengagement theory, but what about its relationship to Erikson’s (1950, 1982, 1986) model of per- sonal development?",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"The argument here is that gerotranscendence goes beyond Erikson’s theory. In both cases the process of aging is regarded as a developmental process, which, at very best, ends with a higher state of maturity—in Erikson’s case, ego-integrity, in ours, gerotranscendence. In Erikson’s theory, the ego-integration primarily refers to an integration of the ele- ments in the life that has passed. The individual reaches a fundamental acceptance of the life lived, regardless of how good or bad it might seem from the outside. In this way the ego-integrity described by Erikson becomes more of a backwards integration process within the same defini- tion of the world as before, while the process of gerotranscendence implies more of a forward or outward direction, including a redefinition of reality. After reading a description of the theory of gerotranscendence, Joan M.Erikson, wife and co-worker of Erik H. Erikson, wrote in a personal communication (1995) to the author of this book:",28,Gerotranscendence,1.0

"So, it seems evident that gerotranscendence goes beyond both disen- gagement and ego-integrity, while it perhaps, in line with Baltes (1993), could be argued that when our respondents talk about an increased broad- mindedness and a tendency to avoid simple distinguishing between right and wrong, this could be understood within the first of Baltes’s three metacriteria of wisdom, which are: 1) Relativism, the development away from ideological positions associated with dogmatism, rightness, and lack of tolerance; 2) Life-span contextualism, the defense against the predomi- nance of the present in the conduct and interpretation of life; and 3) Management of uncertainty, the development away from the hegemony of determinism and rationality.",28,Gerotranscendence,0.5233189444295665
"These criteria seem close to some aspects of gerotranscendence. But, while the aspects of gerotranscendence go beyond our “normal” paradigmatic world, Baltes’s criteria remain within it. When, for example, Baltes describes relativism as a metacriterion of wisdom, he is only describ- ing a behavior or a mode of thinking, while the theory of gerotranscend- ence understands this on a new paradigmatic level. The relativism de- scribed by Baltes is only a specific, manifest aspect of the general tendency to transcend boundaries and old forms of understanding reality, which is the essence of gerotranscendence.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"The question of gerotranscendence and life satisfaction, which builds on the theory’s assumption that the development toward gerotranscen- dence is a natural developmental process associated with an increase in life satisfaction. People who do not reach gerotranscendence are expected to score lower on life satisfaction.",45,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"The question of accelerating or retarding the process of gerotranscendence, which builds on the theory’s assumption that certain life crises can accelerate the process, as for example when severe illness can make an individual redefine reality. Traditionally, such changes are looked upon as defense mechanisms, but the theory of gerotranscendence regards such changes as real changes in the metastructure, not as defense mechanisms. The theory also assumes that individuals who are not hindered by the restrictive norms or values inflicted on them, or who have enough personal resources to withstand such constraints, more easily reach gerotranscendence.",102,Gerotranscendence,0.8024866161578926

At seminars, when the tentative theory was presented, critics suggested that the state of gerotranscendence could be a reaction to, or correlated with, depression and mental illness, since its “symptoms” show some simi- larities. Also, as critics suggested, the consumption of various psy- chotropics might cause the same “symptoms.” Our hypothesis was, on the contrary that gerotranscendence is negatively correlated with depression, mental disturbances, and consumption of psychotropics. Again, this follows from the assumption that development toward gerotranscendence is a natural positive developmental process, which is followed by contentment, satisfaction, and, consequently, reduced need for psychotropics.",80,Gerotranscendence,0.4585800022497839

"The degree of gerotranscendence was approximated by a series of 10 items derived from the theory and after a selection procedure that included qualitative interviews and tests on old people not included in this study. When the offer to participate with questions in this quantitative study came, the qualitative study described in the previous chapter was only in the planning stages. Some test interviews had been made, but the detailed results accounted for in the previous chapter were not available. In the questionnaire, we posed the following question: “We now want to ask you whether your view of life and existence is different today, compared to when you were 50 years of age. Please read the following, and decide what you think of the statements below.” For each of the statements, the respondent had two response alternatives: Yes (I do recog- nize myself in the statement) or No (I do not recognize myself in the statement).

Earlier research has shown that contact between old people and their children and grandchildren tends to be made on the initiative of the latter (Hill, et al., 1979; Teeland, 1978).",66,Social,0.2434725520129486

"A special coping pattern typology was based on four items, where the respondents, using a four-point scale, had to agree or disagree on what they do when they have problems or worries.12 The items form a dimension of defensive coping, and a dimension of offensive coping. These two dimen- sions are not negatively but positively correlated.13 This means that we do not find any support for the assumption that people have either an offensive or a defensive coping style. Rather we find that different combi- nations of both offensive and defensive coping are used. For this reason we have constructed a coping pattern typology based on the two dimen- sions. Low copers (32 percent) are those who are below average on both the offensive and the defensive coping dimensions. Multicopers (28 percent) are those who are above average on both dimensions. Defensive copers (14 percent) are high on the defensive coping dimension, but low on the offensive. Offensive copers (26 percent) are high on the offensive coping dimension, but low on the defensive.",44,Gerotranscendence,1.0

"As to the initial question of recognition it must be noted that quite high proportions of the respondents recognize in themselves the content of the various statements. It is interesting that such a high proportion as 42 percent (in Sweden, 52%) recognize in themselves such a “strange” phenomenon as the disappearance of the distance between past and pres- ent. Several of the statements were recognized by many respondents. This fact can be regarded as a validity confirmation of the measurement.

"When it comes to the age distribution and the degrees of gerotranscen- dence, the theory certainly assumes a correlation with age. The degree of gerotranscendence is expected to increase with age. In this study, however, neither cosmic transcendence nor ego-transcendence show any correlation with the age of the respondent. Nor are there any gender differences in these respects. Controlling for both gender and age at the same time shows the same result.",17,Gerotranscendence,0.9084191128426915
"The lack of age differences can be understood as a result of the study population and the methodology we have used. The sample is quite homogeneous, with all respondents above the age of 74. The methodology implies a retrospective technique, where the respondents compare the present situation with the situation at age 50. Those who have experienced developments in the direction of gerotranscendence might well have done so before the age of 74. As we are going to see in a later section of this book, the expected age correlation will appear when a larger age span is the target of analysis and age groups are compared as to the extent to which they have developed towards gerotranscendence.",22,Gerotranscendence,1.0

Gerotranscendence goes with self- decided activity, not with withdrawal.",70,Gerotranscendence,1.0
Coping Patterns,44,Gerotranscendence,0.637949238097324
"Further, if gerotranscendence were the same as disengagement or part of a breakdown syndrome, the predicted coping patterns would be an increasing proportion of low copers and defensive copers, with increasing degrees of gerotranscendence. We find the opposite. With increasing degrees of cosmic and ego-transcendence, we find increasing proportions of offensive copers and multicopers.15",44,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"Two differences between respondents with high and low degrees of cosmic transcendence are especially interesting. First, the proportion of lowcopers is considerably higher among the respondents with a low degree of cosmic transcendence (41 percent) compared with the respondents with a high degree of cosmic transcendence (26 percent). Second, the proportion of multicopers is considerably higher among the respondents with a high degree of cosmic transcendence (33 percent) compared with respondents with a low degree of cosmic transcendence (22 percent). The same type of differences are found when comparing respondents with high and low degrees of ego-transcendence, even if the differences in this case are not as pronounced. These findings contradict the assumption that gerotranscendence is the same as or part of a negative disengagement or a breakdown syndrome. Instead we find a pattern where high degrees of gerotranscendence are combined with more coping, more offensive coping, and more multicoping.",44,Gerotranscendence,0.7002830604582689

Life Satisfaction,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"The data show positive correlations between life satisfaction and the degree of both cosmic17 and ego-transcendence.18 The higher the degree of transcendence, the higher the life satisfaction. These correlations are, however, somewhat modified when you take the degree of social activity into consideration. The degree of social activity correlates with life satis- faction19, and when both the degree of social activity and the degree of cosmic transcendence are introduced as independents in an MCA analysis20 with the life satisfaction as dependent, we can conclude that both types of gerotranscendence show a remaining correlation with life satisfaction.21 This also applies when we control for the degree of social activity, even if social activity, generally speaking, seems to be the more important predictor of life satisfaction.",24,Transcendence,1.0
"The intercorrelations between social activity, gerotranscendence, and life satisfaction however show a theoretically quite interesting pattern. The original correlation between the degree of social activity and life satisfaction decreases when we take gerotranscendence into consideration. The higher the degree of cosmic transcendence, the weaker is the correla- tion between social activity and life satisfaction. In other words, the more transcendent the respondent, the less essential is the degree of social activity for life satisfaction. The modifying effect of ego-transcendence on the correlation between social activity and life satisfaction shows the same tendency, though it is not as obvious (see Tornstam, 1994, for details).",24,Transcendence,0.7207274445370708
"Also when the satisfaction with social activity is analyzed in relation to the degree of social activity, we find that the degree of gerotranscen- dence has the same modifying effect—the more transcendent the respon- dent, the weaker the correlation between the degree of social activity and the satisfaction with social activity. Again, this is especially pronounced when we control for the degree of cosmic transcendence.",24,Transcendence,1.0
"In summary, we find a new pattern where a high degree of transcendence— especially cosmic transcendence—is related to a higher degree of both life satisfac- tion and satisfaction with social activity, at the same time as the degree of social activity itself becomes less essential for life satisfaction at the higher levels of gerotranscendence.",24,Transcendence,1.0
"Also in the longitudinal perspective, there is a connection between gerotranscendence and the change in life satisfaction. Since the 1990 Danish retrospective study is part of a longitudinal study, we have informa- tion about the degree of life satisfaction at two points in time, 1986 and 1990.",45,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"As expected, most respondents report the same degree of life satisfac- tion at both points of measurement. When changes occurred, however, they were correlated to the degrees of both cosmic and ego-transcendence. Those who rated low on gerotranscendence in 1990 were more likely to have decreased in life satisfaction between 1986 and 1990. Those who rated high on gerotranscendence in 1990 have been stable in life satisfac- tion between 1986 and 1990.",125,Transcenders,0.9121209738664496
"The causal interpretation of the above finding is somewhat difficult, since the degrees of gerotranscendence were measured only in 1990, while the longitudinal changes in life satisfaction refer to the changes between 1986 and 1990. If, however, the measure of the two types of gerotranscen- dence is tapping a developmental process starting before both measure- ments (as implied by the phrasing of the items), one causal interpretation could be the following: The reason that we find a correlation between gerotranscendence and life satisfaction in a cross-sectional analysis might not be that a high degree of gerotranscendence produces higher life satisfaction, but rather that, to a certain extent, it prevents decreases in life satisfaction. This is however nothing but an hypothesis, which needs to be tested in a longitudinal study where both gerotranscendence and life satisfaction are measured at several points in time.",45,Gerotranscendence,0.6206144846379874
Facilitating or Obstructing Gerotranscendence,3,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"The process of gerotranscendence can, according to the theory, be acceler- ated, facilitated or obstructed in different ways. One assumption was that",3,Gerotranscendence,0.5474102973912455
"major crises in life might facilitate the restructuring of the definition of reality, as implied by the theory. One such crisis, used as a test variable in this context, is the death of a spouse or another close person. In this material22 203 respondents (22 percent) had experienced such a loss during the 12 months preceding the data collection in 1990. When the respon- dents who experienced such a loss were compared with the ones who did not, we found the degree of cosmic transcendence to be somewhat higher among those who experienced that loss.23 No such differences were found as to the degree of ego-transcendence. It seems reasonable to assume that it was the crisis of losing a close person that caused an increase in the degree of cosmic transcendence.",11,Cosmic,0.2728893886895409
"We also found that the degree of cosmic transcendence is correlated with the type of work the respondent had before retirement, and with social class. Respondents who had white-collar work or were metropolitan entrepreneurs had somewhat higher degrees of cosmic transcendence than others24. Also, the degree of cosmic transcendence was found to be higher among the respondents in the higher social classes25. The common denom- inator in these observations might be that the respondents with the higher degrees of cosmic transcendence had led less restricted lives with higher degrees of personal freedom. Their personal development was less hin- dered by limiting rules or values.",141,Entrepreneurs,1.0
"This interpretation is in line with the reasoning of Chinen (1989a) who, as described earlier, analyzed the scientific works of Ludwig Witt- genstein and Alfred North Withed, and found that their way of working became more qualitative and “transcendent” in their later years.",84,Scientists,1.0
"In summary, we do find some evidence that the degree of cosmic transcendence might be affected by both life crises and other facilitating or restricting factors. It should be observed, however, that this statement is only valid for cosmic transcendence. The empirical findings, however, support the assumption that the development of gerotranscendence is not only dependent on pure age development, but is also affected by social- matrix factors and incident-impact factors. Social position, including type of work, is an example of a social-matrix factor. Illness and perceived crises in life are examples of incident-impact factors.",47,Reminiscence,0.3922223008978489

"The old age depression scale does not correlate with either cosmic transcendence or ego-transcendence. That the complete set of items in this scale was used only at the 1986 measurement poses a methodological problem. Hence, the correlation refers to the depression value in 1986 and the gerotranscendence values in 1990. Two of the specific items in the old age depression scale were used, however, in 1990. Neither of these (feeling lonely, feeling old) correlated with the gerotranscendence scales. It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that gerotranscendence is not to be seen as a depression correlate or defense reaction caused by old age depression. The same conclusion holds concerning psychological strain. The psychological strain scale does not correlate with any one of the gerotranscendence measures.",17,Gerotranscendence,0.47302524182597894
Nor is the assumption that the use of psychotropics is related to gerotranscendence supported by our data. The only statistically significant correlation in this respect is the negative correlation between the use of psychopharmacological drugs26 and the gerotranscendence scales. In both,80,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"cases the correlation indicates that respondents who used psychopharma- cological drugs in 1986 had lower degrees of both cosmic and ego-transcen- dence in 1990. If any causal conclusion should be drawn from this, it should be that the consumption of psychopharmacological drugs is a hindrance to achieving gerotranscendence.",80,Gerotranscendence,1.0
One Step Ahead,15,Conclusions,0.6465410768519189
This chapter has brought us another step closer to an empirical illumina- tion of gerotranscendence. From the answers to the items included in the gerotranscendence measures it can be concluded that the items touch upon something that is recognized by the respondents. Significant propor- tions of the respondents recognize in themselves the changes expressed by the items. From the initial description of the theory it should be obvious that the points of departure for the theory of gerotranscendence are quite different from the interactionist theories and the “activity the- ory.” But is gerotranscendence something new and different from the old concept of disengagement? Several of the results described in this study indicate that it is.,120,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"First, the very content of the statements forming the gerotranscen- dence scales is different from the disengagement concept. While “disen- gagement” only implies a turning inwards, “gerotranscendence” implies a new definition of reality.",120,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"Second, while disengagement is connected with social withdrawal, our data show gerotranscendence to be positively correlated with social activity, at the same time as a greater need for solitary “philosophizing” is experienced. But, and most important, the social activities positively correlated with gerotranscendence are activities where more of the initia- tive for activity rests with the individual.",170,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"Third, the coping patterns of the respondents with high degrees of gerotranscendence certainly do not correspond to what would be pre- dicted by the theory of disengagement, nor by the assumption that gero- transcendence is an aspect of a social breakdown syndrome. Instead of reporting passive or defensive coping strategies, we find that respondents with high degrees of gerotranscendence make greater use of “offensive” and multicoping patterns.",44,Gerotranscendence,0.2848765017305894
"Fourth, we have found a new pattern where a high degree of especially cosmic transcendence is related to a higher degree of both life satisfaction and satisfaction with social activity, at the same time as the degree of social activity becomes less essential for satisfaction at the higher levels",24,Transcendence,1.0
of gerotranscendence. All this leads us to the conclusion that the concept of gerotranscendence is clearly different from both the old concepts of disengagement and social breakdown syndrome.,70,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"The concept of gerotranscendence is more closely related to Gut- man’s previously mentioned concept of “passive and magical mastery.” Gutmann, however, regards this shift toward passive and magical mastery to be an adaptation by the individual, made necessary by individual and social changes in the aging process whereby the changes described become effects of the impact of social aging. Strained to a fine point, the changes toward passive and magical mastery become, for Gutmann, defense mech- anisms. In this respect, the theory of gerotranscendence is very different, both from the pure theoretical perspective and from the empirical one. To conclude, then, we find it evident that the concept of gerotrans- cendence is a new concept, different from other well known theoretical concepts in gerontology. According to the response patterns, it is seem- ingly also relevant for the personal experiences of some older people. Furthermore, it may prove to be a theoretically fruitful concept since it focuses on new types of developmental patterns and combinations, for example, the combination of high degrees of gerotranscendence, social activity, multicoping and life satisfaction.

"Drawing on the previous qualitative and quantitative studies, a series of questions and statements were framed in accordance with the previously described dimensions of gerotranscendence. Statements were worded in order to tap the status of these dimensions—not the retrospective change as in the 1990 Danish study. Each respondent was asked to rate how poorly or well each statement agreed with his or her own experience and feelings on a fixed four-point scale. So, while the previous Danish study had its focus on retrospective descriptions of change, the Swedish 1995 study aimed at snapshot presentations of the gerotranscendence level in various parts of the population.",111,Gerotranscendence,0.8620722000669003
The answers to the statements were analyzed by an explorative princi- pal component factor analysis which produced the dimensions in Table 4.3.28,122,Factors,1.0
"The main factor, the cosmic dimension, captures quite well what was also the “main factor” in the previous studies—the transcendence of time, space, and objects. We refer to this as cosmic transcendence. The coherence dimension in the factor analysis corresponding to the “ego-integrity” under the “self” dimension in the previous qualitative analysis and the solitude dimension corresponds to the “changed meaning and importance of rela- tions” under the social and individual relations dimension.

Additive indices have also been constructed for the measurement of diseases and life crises. Respondents were asked to read a list of common diseases and mark the diseases they suffered from. The number of diseases,20,Crises,1.0
"were added to create a simple index. In the same vein, the respondents were asked if they, during the last two years, had experienced something they regarded as a life crisis. The respondents could mark a number of predefined crises as well as add other types of crises.

"All of the above-mentioned variables have remaining explanatory power (beta values) when we control for the others.32 When the above- mentioned variables are entered into an CHAID33 analysis, the subgroup with the highest value on cosmic transcendence is identified by age alone. On a five-point scale of cosmic transcendence, 31 percent of the oldest respondents (75–85) have the highest value. We might call them “trans- cenders.” The subgroup with the lowest degree of cosmic transcendence is, according to the CHAID analysis, identified by age, gender, and crises: Men, between 20 and 44 years of age, who have not experienced any crisis during the two years previous to the study, are the least likely to have experienced cosmic transcendence. In this group only 7 percent are “transcenders.”",65,Transcendence,0.89322690576243
"In Figure 4.1a the degree of cosmic transcendence is shown in relation to age and gender. Four characteristics in this graph should be noted: First, the general pattern shows a gradually increasing degree of cosmic transcendence with increasing age. There is no sudden increase between any specific age groups. Second, women score higher on cosmic transcen- dence than men. Third, the difference between women and men decreases with age up to the age category 65–75. Fourth, in the last age category there is a split between men and women. The women continue the increase while the men drop.34 (Figure 4.1b is commented on later.)",5,Cosmic,1.0
An interesting observation concerning this gender difference is that it disappears when we compare men and women who are not cohabiting,106,Cohabiting,1.0

None of the differences between the slopes for men and women are statistically significant, so we should rather focus on an “average.” In this case, we notice that there is not a continuous increase in the need for solitude with age. The need for solitude increases up to the age category of 35–44 and remains quite stable after that. We are, then, disregarding and averaging the statistically insignificant divergent tendencies among men and women in the oldest age categories.

Discussion of the Cross Sectional Findings,124,Sectional,1.0
"The main purpose of the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study was to address the following question: Would it be possible, in a study including",63,Statistically,0.8968062742001891
"people from a wide age range, to find age differences of the same kind as implied in the previous qualitative and retrospective quantitative studies of exclusively older people?",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"A special problem in this regard is that it was impossible to use the same measures. This is obvious when comparisons with the previous qualitative study are considered. We also have the same type of problem when it comes to comparisons between the two quantitative studies. In the previous quantitative Danish 1990 study, all statements were formulated retrospectively since all the respondents were at the same end of the age scale (74–100). The respondents were asked to compare their situation at age 50 with their situation at the time of the survey. In the Swedish cross-sectional 1995 study, the statements had to be designed in order to tap the present situation only. Thus, by comparing age categories, it should be possible to make some cautious conclusions about develop- mental patterns. So, derived from the results of the previous studies, the statements for the 1995 cross-sectional 1995 study were worded with the aim of capturing static, snapshot values of what, in the previous studies, were descriptions of processes. This methodological difference should be kept in mind when interpreting the empirical findings.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Another thing to be observed when interpreting the findings, is the limitations of the cross-sectional design. Any difference between age categories could, in theory at least, be an unknown mix of cohort effects and individual developments. With these pointers in mind we can proceed with a further discussion of the cross sectional findings.",124,Sectional,1.0
"Drawing on the outcome of the analyses of the dimensions given by the factor analysis, and again operating under the assumption that our cross-sectional data can be interpreted from a developmental perspective, we are able to suggest that both the general cosmic and the general coherence aspects of gerotranscendence develop in principally continuous ways. The general solitude aspect, on the other hand, develops in another way, with an early increase in the need for solitude and thereafter a steady state. We must, however, again make the reservation that our present data set is limited in several ways, culturally, temporally, and in age span. It ends with individuals at age 85. The outcome of an analysis based on a data set including even older individuals from other cultures and other cohorts might alter the above conclusions. However, as we are going to see, a later replication of this study conducted on a sample including older respondents (65–104) will confirm and elucidate the findings described above.",17,Gerotranscendence,1.0
Modifiers,13,Staff,0.21684915182568937
"Even if some aspects or dimensions of gerotranscendence are referred to as general in the sense that they show a statistically significant correlation with age, some circumstances do modify these correlations. Gender, crises, and life circumstances have been found to be such modifiers. We refer to such modifiers as social-matrix factors and incidence-impact factors.",153,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"The outcome given by the factor analyses show that women score higher than men on cosmic transcendence, even though there is a tendency towards reduction of this difference, at least up to the age category 64–75. This finding parallels the perspective of generally diminishing gender personality differences with age (Huyck, 1990). In our case, the men, especially from the age category 35–44, rapidly catch up with the women. This might suggest that before this age men are too trapped by gender- role success activities to be open to this kind of development. If the “mid- life crisis” comes, this might pave the way for the further development of cosmic transcendence. The women’s higher levels of cosmic transcen- dence, especially in the age interval 25–44, might be partly connected with childbirth. A closer analysis has shown that the difference between men and women in terms of cosmic transcendence is smaller, but not absent, when comparing women without children with men. For the men it doesn’t matter if they have children or not. The age slope of cosmic transcendence is just about the same. For that reason the undivided men category can be compared with women who have children and women don’t.",5,Cosmic,1.0
"Figure 4.1b shows that, among women with children, the degree of cosmic transcendence increases significantly already in the age category 25–34 and continues to increase all the way up to the highest age category. It might be that, for many women, giving birth to a child represents such a developmental crisis when definitions of life are reconstructed.",5,Cosmic,0.5908344477129561
"We also have the drop among cohabiting men 75–85 years of age to consider. At this point, we can only speculate on this empirical finding. The result could also be, even if this statistical probability is low, a product of sampling error. If we accept the empirical finding as a fact, one explanation could be that the men in this cohort and in this culture carry with them some particular experiences in life that might explain their divergence. We will return to this issue later on.",108,95,1.0
The rapid increase in cosmic transcendence among men from age category 34–44 through 45–54 also has its correspondence when it con-,5,Cosmic,0.6898042696130665
"cerns coherence. The degree of coherence drops to a minimum in the age category 35–44 and increases rapidly after that (Figure 4.2). An explanation for this might be found along the same lines as above. If we stick to the statistical rules of the game, this study shows no gender difference in the solitude dimension of gerotranscendence (Figure 4.3).",17,Gerotranscendence,0.7103652106588713
"Having experienced a crisis in life is, according to our analysis, con- nected with higher degrees of cosmic transcendence, but lower degrees of coherence. The previous 1990 Danish retrospective study showed that individuals who, during the year previous to the survey, experienced the death of a person close to them had higher values on the cosmic gerotranscendence dimension. In the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study, the crisis measure was wider, including anything that the respondent perceived as a crisis in life, but the result is the same. With crises come higher levels of cosmic transcendence. But, this does not hold true for the coherence dimension. What we find is the somewhat contradictory pattern that crises affect one dimension of gerotranscendence positively and another one negatively. This finding paves the way for a discussion of the possible “causal” and temporal interrelations between the dimen- sions of gerotranscendence. Might a crisis-induced decrease in coherence after some time be “repaired” by the simultaneous crisis induced increase in cosmic transcendence? This is yet another question to be answered in future research. In a following chapter we are going to take a closer look at various crises in old age, and their connection with gerotranscendence.",47,Reminiscence,1.0
"Illness has, according to the analyses, a modifying effect similar in part to other crises. As far as the cosmic dimension concerns, illness shows a positive simple bivariate correlation with cosmic transcendence. But, when we control for the experience of crises (Table 4.4), the effect of illness disappears. A possible interpretation of this is that illness creates an increase in the cosmic transcendence only to the degree to which it is experienced as a crisis. Illness has, on the other hand, remaining effects on both the solitude and the coherence dimensions (Tables 4.5 and 4. 6). Both the cosmic transcendence and the coherence dimension are, ac- cording to the analysis, affected by life circumstances. Respondents with self-governed professions and students score higher on cosmic transcen- dence. Maybe a life with higher degrees of autonomy contributes to a liberation from restrictive, mainstream rules and values which might otherwise have reduced the possibility for development of cosmic",47,Reminiscence,0.23858279674324379

"Gerotranscendence, Life Satisfaction, and Fear of Death",45,Gerotranscendence,0.4144531003162542
"Working from the results of the previous qualitative study, we assumed that individuals with higher degrees of gerotranscendence would score higher on life satisfaction. That was in fact demonstrated in the previous 1990 Danish retrospective study where we found a statistically significant correlation between the measure of cosmic transcendence and life satisfac- tion.43 In the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study we did not find the corresponding correlation. This fact can be understood in several ways, for example: While the previous 1990 Danish retrospective study focused on experienced changes in aspects of gerotranscendence, the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study taps the static value of these aspects. Having a “high” value in this snapshot perspective might be very different from having experienced a change. It might be the experience of a developmental change, rather than having a high or low value on cosmic transcendence, that induces or is connected with high life satisfaction.",125,Transcenders,1.0
"Another explanation might be provided by referring to the differences in the age ranges used in the studies. We shall later see how the correlation reappears when we address an older group of respondents. Remember that the previous 1990 Danish retrospective study had a sample in the age range 74–100 years, while the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study has the age range 20–85 years. This explanation might also be applicable when trying to understand why, in the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study, we did not find any correlation between cosmic transcendence and fear of death, as was hypothesized on the basis of the previous qualitative study. When later we examine a sample including respondents 65–104 years of age, the correlation between cosmic transcendence and life satis- faction will reappear, suggesting that increased life satisfaction is a fruit of gerotranscendence that is reserved for old age.",125,Transcenders,1.0
"The coherence dimension shows a very strong and positive correla- tion with our measure of life satisfaction, and a modest but statistically",109,Coherence,1.0
"highly significant negative correlation with fear of death. So, if simple explanations are sought, the experience of coherence is very beneficial for life satisfaction and absence of fear of death. But, on the other hand, the concepts of coherence and life satisfaction are too close to be viewed in a causal perspective.",151,Coherence,1.0
Conclusions Thus Far,15,Conclusions,1.0
"In the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study, which was yet a further small step towards the empirical exploration of the theory of gerotranscendence, we have found cross-sectional age differences which we cautiously, yet venturesomely, interpret in a developmental way. We do so because the main purpose of this empirical step was to see whether the results from earlier research using retrospective developmental perspectives could be replicated in a cross-sectional study.",22,Gerotranscendence,0.42503114425361394
"Drawing, then, on the response patterns of the statements we have used and the scales we have constructed, we find patterns of the kind found in previous qualitative and quantitative studies of exclusively elderly people. We have found cross sectional age patterns of increasing cosmic transcen- dence, coherence, and need for solitude. Our data suggest that the development of cosmic transcendence and coherence are continuous processes which start already during the first half of the adult life and gradually develop to their maximum in later life. The need for solitude also reaches its maximum in late life, but develops most rapidly during the first half of adult life. We have found that women score higher than men on cosmic transcendence, but that this difference decreases with increasing age. We also have discovered, however, a gender difference not found in the previous 1990 Danish retrospective study—the male drop in cosmic transcendence in the age category 75–85. We will return to this surprising finding in a later section of this book.",5,Cosmic,0.5081101530633269
"Not only age, but also social-matrix factors and incidence-impact factors have been shown to correlate with gerotranscendence. Life crises seem- ingly affect the dimensions of gerotranscendence, as do profession and income. A possible interpretation of the latter is that an autonomous life contributes to a liberation from rules and values which might otherwise have reduced the possibility for the development of transcendence.",153,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"Theoretically, the results from the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study suggest, in line with the previous studies, that there is a process of gerotranscendence, but also that this process may appear different depending on cohort affiliation, gender, and life circumstances. It is not",117,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"unlikely that a comparative study would show the process of gerotranscen- dence to be somewhat different in different cultures. As with, for example, Jung’s archetypes, the core concept (e.g., the archetype of the “wise man”) is general, but its expressions are culturally dependent (in some places the “wise man” is a woman44).",8,Gerotranscendence,0.6914452002737422
"In fact, Ahmadi (1998, 2000a, 2000b, 2001) has elaborated on this, and found that cultural elements surely are to be regarded as modifiers to the development of gerotranscendence. While Chinen (1986) pointed to supportive folk tales in certain cultures, Ahmadi points to the more fundamental ways of thinking—of constructing reality—which differ among cultures. If the culture, for example, entails elements of Sufism, individuals have been shown to develop gerotranscendence more easily.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

Our data suggested that cosmic transcendence and coherence are principally continuous developmental processes that begin during the first half of adult life and gradually develop to their maximum in later life. The need for solitude also has its maximum in late life, but develops most rapidly during the first half of adult life. Looking back on the earlier studies, we find that three types of factors seem to influence or explain the degree of gerotranscendence that a respondent reports: 1) pure age development, 2) social-matrix factors (e.g., gender, marital status, occupation), and 3) incident-impact factors (e.g., illnesses, crises).",17,Gerotranscendence,0.5795850634057506
"We found, for example, that women score higher than men on cosmic transcendence, but that this difference decreases with increasing age. Yet, we also discovered a puzzling gender difference—a drop in male cosmic transcendence in the age category 75–85—which was one of the things that prompted us to take a closer look, with a new sample, at the upper end of the age scale. Whereas the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study included the whole age range from 20 to 85, only 190 Ss (9.5% of the sample) fell into the age category 75–85. Also, no respondents above the age of 85 were included in the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study.

Statements were worded so as to elicit a snapshot status of these dimensions. Table 4.7 shows all of the statements as well as the dimensions of gerotranscendence they are supposed to tap.

In the same vein, the respondents were asked if they had experienced something they regarded as a life crisis during the past two years. The respondents could mark a number of predefined crises as well as add other types of crises.

"As seen in Figure 4.4, the 2001 data focusing on ages 65+ replicate the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study by showing a statistically significant final increase in cosmic transcendence for women,48 but not for men. The arch-shaped slope for men is not statistically significant. Nor is the split between men and women from age 85+. Thus, the present study replicates this split, but not with statistical significance.49 Since the split appears later in the age categorization in the 2001 study (65+) as compared with the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study, it might be that we are dealing with a cohort difference. For some reason, it might be the men born between 1910–1920 that deviate from the otherwise consistent pattern of increasing cosmic transcendence.",5,Cosmic,1.0
"The Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study however suggested that the aforementioned gender split could be related to social-matrix factors such as marital or cohabiting status.

"It is noteworthy that the initially insignificant correlation with age turns into a significant positive correlation when other variables are con- trolled for.

Having had diseases, however, reveals a slightly different pattern. When other factors are controlled for, the diseases factor loses its explanatory power.

Before controlling for other variables, there is a significant difference in coherence between respondents in different types of housing.

"The activity measure has a substantial and remaining correlation with coherence. This correlation is, with some small variations, found for all age groups from 65 to 95+.

"Another factor not introduced in the ANOVA analysis, since it is a conceptually related variable rather than a predictor, we again found a very strong correlation between coherence and life satisfaction60. This replicates the finding in the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study where, for the whole sample 20–85, the corresponding correlation was of the same magnitude. This strong correlation, with some small variation, is found in each of the age categories from 65 to 95+.",109,Coherence,1.0
Who Experiences High Coherence?,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"The node with the largest proportion of coherence is defined in terms of noncrises, high activity, and skilled former profession. Among the 193 respondents who had experienced no crises during the past two years, and had had some qualified profession, as well as high activity, 40 percent belong to the high-coherence group. If a coherence index is set to 100 in the starting node (the whole sample), the index value in the high-coherence group is 152.

"According to the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study, with data for respon- dents between 20 and 85 years of age, the need for solitude was shown to start to increase early.

Among a set of 18 possible predictors65 only three show statistically significant correlations of at least 0.10. These are age, civil status, and diseases. As mentioned above, with advanced age comes an increased need for soli- tude.66 Also, the respondents who are widowed, unmarried, or divorced are slightly more solitude-seeking than are the married/cohabiting ones.67 Furthermore, respondents with diseases have a slightly higher need for solitude in comparison with the healthy ones.68 Also, understandably, the respondents who have a higher need for solitude report less social activity. They are lower on the activity index.69",52,Solitude,0.7226703863523108
"When the predictor variables age, civil status, and diseases are intro- duced in an ANOVA-MCA analysis, the explanatory power of each pre- dictor drops considerably. The interpretation here is that the predictors are intertwined, but that none of them has major explanatory power over the others. Age, civil status, and diseases each have some limited explanatory power with respect to the need for solitude. It should be remembered, however, that we are now talking about explanations that apply within the limited age span 65–104 (the 2001 study (65+). When the larger age span 20+ is considered (the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study and the 2001 study (65+) taken together), there is a distinct and consistent increase in the need for solitude with age. There seems to be a growing need for solitude that is dependent solely on age, i.e., a developmental factor, which can be altered by social-matrix factors, such as civil status, and incident-impact factors, such as burdens of diseases and crises.",48,Solitude,1.0

Transcendence and Life Satisfaction,24,Transcendence,1.0
"The theory presumes that an increase in gerotranscendence, particularly cosmic transcendence, is accompanied by an increase in life satisfaction. This assumption was based on the previously reported qualitative inter- views underlying the theory. In one of our quantitative studies, the 1990 Danish retrospective study, the assumption was confirmed by an expected positive correlation, but the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study (ages 20–85) study showed no such correlation. In the 2001 (65+) study of the upper end of the age scale, we again obtained statistically significant correlations between satisfaction with life and cosmic transcendence72 and coherence,73 but a negative correlation with the need for solitude.74",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"The next category, with about half or less of the explanatory power of coherence, includes activity, crises, health, and cosmic transcendence.

"The last group of predictors, including civil status, former profession, age, and need for solitude, initially showed significant correlations with life satisfaction, but these are more or less swept away when other, more crucial and co-varying predictors are introduced. Age is an example of this. The initial correlation between age and satisfaction is a weak, but statistically a significantly negative one. With higher age comes a slight decrease in satisfaction with present life. When other predictors are intro- duced, however, this significant correlation is practically swept away, showing that the small decrease in satisfaction with life has little to do with age per se, but is related to other correlates of age.76",92,Solitude,1.0
"As regards the gerotranscendence measures, we can conclude that cosmic transcendence and surely coherence are positively correlated with satisfaction with present life, even when controlling for other probable predictors.

Summing Up,156,65,1.0
"In our search for explanatory factors concerning the development of gerotranscendence, we have found three types of explanatory factors when looking at data from both the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study (ages 20–85) and the 2001 study (65+): age-developmental factors, social-matrix factors, and incident-impact factors. Gerotranscendence can be understood as a developmental process, sometimes modified by social-matrix factors, such as gender and profession, and by incident-impact factors, such as diseases and crises.",102,Gerotranscendence,0.5555264356949094
"We can suggest that, during the major part of adult life, there seems to be a developmental pattern of increased cosmic transcendence. This increase levels out at the high end of the age scale. In the younger age categories, the degree of gerotranscendence is also modified by social-matrix factors and incident-impact factors, but these factors seem to have lost their importance when old age is reached.",17,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"At the outset of the 2001 (65+) study, our intention was to shed some light on a puzzling gender difference in cosmic transcendence found in the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study (ages 20–85), which showed a continuous development with age for women, but a final age drop for men. In the 2001 study (65+), this pattern was replicated, but with a time lag, hinting at a possible cohort phenomenon.",5,Cosmic,1.0
"The pattern from the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study, showing married/cohabiting men to have a lower degree of cosmic transcendence in comparison with married/cohabiting women, was not replicated in the 2001 study (65+). Instead, this study indicates that the experience of crises seems to affect old men and women differently. For women 65+, the",11,Cosmic,0.2888743771353679
"experience of crises seems to have lost its effect on the level of cosmic transcendence. Also for men 65–94, the experience of crises seems to have lost its effect, while the effect appears to become negative for the oldest men, those 95+. This brings to mind the old Chinese saying that crises carry the potential of both threat and opportunity. To gain a deeper understanding of this, we will probably have to use other qualitative methods.",11,Cosmic,0.39502219750338713
"The coherence dimension of gerotranscendence is different from the cosmic dimension in that both social-matrix factors and incident-impact factors still play a role in old age. In old age, the developmental factor, the social-matrix factors, and the incident-impact factors seem to be independently and equally important.",17,Gerotranscendence,0.6275413836276563
"The solitude dimension also shows a similar pattern. There seems to be a clear developmental age factor, still prevalent in old age, supple- mented with some social-matrix factors and incident-impact factors. There seems to be an age-dependent and growing need for solitude, a developmental factor, which can be affected by factors such as widowhood, divorce, and diseases.",52,Solitude,0.7652753187047526
"Finally, returning to the positive correlation between cosmic tran- scendence and satisfaction with present life in the 2001 (65+) study, we presume that cosmic transcendence is positively related to life satisfaction in old age, but not among younger subjects. In two different empirical studies, both focusing on older respondents (the 1990 Danish retrospective study, and the 2001 study (65+)), we have found this positive correlation between cosmic transcendence and satisfaction with life, while the Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study focusing on ages 20–85, showed no significant correlation. Thus, the combination of cosmic transcendence and satisfac- tion with present life would seem to be a fruit especially reserved for old age.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
LIFE CRISES AND GEROTRANSCENDENCE,43,Crises,1.0
"The theory of gerotranscendence suggests that life crises, as incidence- impact factors, may sometimes accelerate development toward gerotrans- cendence.

In agreement with this, the 1990 Danish retrospective study of 912 representative men and women between 74 and 100 years",43,Crises,0.2953701341761263
of age showed that individuals who had experienced the death of a loved one during the last year before the survey scored higher on the cosmic dimension of gerotranscendence.

This percentage increases with age",36,Crises,0.8376977442913256

"Second, and quite contrary to what might be expected from a misery perspective of aging, the proportion of respondents who had experienced a crisis in life in connection with another person’s disease did not increase with age. There is no statistically significant correlation between this type of crisis and age. This is also the case for crises in connection with another person’s death. We shall return to these seemingly strange findings below. Third, crises related to partner separations decrease with age and, fourth, other types of crises also decrease with age. The most frequent “other” types of crises reported by the respondents were crises related to unemployment (25 respondents), family conflicts (21), problems at work (18), and the economy (18). In exceptional cases, crises concerning the war in Europe, accidents, drug problems, and abortion were mentioned. One single respondent reported a life crisis in connection with “becoming old” and another single respondent mentioned “early retirement” as hav- ing caused a crisis. None of the respondents mentioned ordinary retire- ment as a crisis in life. (Approximately 100 of the respondents may have",12,Widowhood,1.0

Our data showed that the majority of the respondents, 68 percent, had not experienced any life crises at all during the previous two years; 27 percent of the respondents had experienced only one crisis. Four percent had experienced two crises, and only one percent (19 respondents) had experi- enced three different crises. Since this distribution is extremely skewed, the following analyses are based on a dichotomized measure of crises— respondents who had not experienced any crises and respondents who had experienced one or more crises during the last two years.",20,Crises,0.06149109688597048

Even if the age variable is dichotomized in two age groups, 20–74 and 75–85, the difference between these two age groups is very small, and statistically significant only among the women.78 Among the “younger” (20–74) women, 35 percent had experienced one or more crises during the previous two years, as compared with 45 percent of the older (75–85) women.

But, the table also reveals that these correlations are primarily focused on the first four age categories embracing the age span 20–54. Data from the 2001 (65+) study further support this observation. In this later study, there is no correlation between the experiences of crises and cosmic transcendence.

Second, this difference decreases with age. While the difference in reported coherence between those who had and those who had not experienced crises is considerable among respondents 20–24 years of age,84 this difference is, statistically speaking, almost nonex- istent among the respondents 75–85 years of age.85 In the 2001 (65+) study, this trend is not fully followed.

"In Figure 4.14 this pattern is also shown for those having and not having experienced a crisis in life during the last two years. Respondents who had experienced a crisis in life systematically reported a higher need for solitude in comparison to respondents who had not experienced any crises. This systematic difference is, however, rather small. Only for two",162,Solitude,1.0
age categories did this difference reach statistical significance: ages 25–3487 and ages 65–74.88 In both cases the difference was caused by men who had experienced crises. They deviated with higher need for solitude. In the 2001 (65+) study there was no correlation at all between the experience of crises during the previous two years and the need for solitude.,48,Solitude,0.9550957950120018
Summing Up the Crisis Perspective,75,Crises,1.0
"Before returning to the main focus, how crises relate to gerotranscen- dence, it may be interesting to note that from the “misery perspective” of aging, it has almost been taken for granted that old age is connected with stress and crises (Rodin, 1986). Several empirical findings seem, however, to contradict this assumption. Paykel (1983) found, for example, that younger people report more stress and crises than the elderly. Several explanations to these paradoxical findings have been suggested. Aldwin, Sutton, Chiara and Spiri (1996) discuss a series of such explanations, ranging from measurement errors to developmental changes in appraisal",12,Widowhood,0.9319063289723241
"and coping. We can see this, as described in a previous chapter, as an example of how we tend to explain away findings that do not fit our favorite theories. Here we will only briefly refer to some of these explanations since our aim is not to test them per se. Our main objective is to find out if crises in life are related to the dimensions of gerotranscendence.",43,Crises,0.3015551418587176
"We have defined life crises as those events which people themselves define as crises. No life event, regardless of how stressful it might appear to an outsider, has been defined as a crisis in life unless it has been characterized in that way by the respondent. Given the above definition of life crises, several observations should be noted.",75,Crises,1.0
"The composition of life crises differs between age groups. Each age has its own types of crises. The frequency of certain types of life crises increases with age, while the frequency of others decreases with age. The Swedish 1995 cross-sectional study showed that crises in life related to a person’s own disease increased with age, while crises connected with separation or other circumstances decreased. Noteworthy is the fact that subjectively defined life crises in connection with other peoples’ diseases or death showed no correlation with age. There might be a very simple explanation for this lack of correlation: It is easy to assume that old people must experience more unavoidable diseases and deaths of loved ones, but we forget that it is equally unavoidable that parents fall ill and die away from young people, who thereby are exposed to the possibility of experiencing a crisis in connection with another persons death.",12,Widowhood,1.0
"But, given the assumption that we objectively experience more disease and death with increasing age, this lack of correlation can be understood in terms of age-related changes in appraisal and coping, as mentioned above. A related explanation can be found in Neugarten’s (1977) concept of timing. There is a schedule for events in life which, by its very existence, prepares us for these events, provided they happen on schedule. This schedule of life events teaches us, for example, that disease and widowhood are unlikely events in our younger years, but likely in old age. In line with this, Blau (1973) found that elderly widows experienced less stress than young widows. The widowhood of the elderly women was on sched- ule, while the widowhood of young women was off schedule. Regardless of theoretical explanations, the fact itself should be remembered: When using a subjective definition of life crises, there is no correlation between respondent’s age and the experience of a crisis in life in connection with other people’s diseases or death in particular.",12,Widowhood,1.0
"The above-mentioned concept of timing can also explain why none of the respondents connected ordinary retirement with a life crisis. This is by now a recurrent pattern in social gerontological research findings. The trauma expected by many scholars in connection with retirement does not materialize in empirical research. Aldwin (1990) has shown that retirement generally has a very low stress value. It is at the very bottom of a long list of possible stressors in old age. (For a general discussion of these findings see Robinson, Coberly, & Paul, 1985.)",165,Retirement,1.0
Regarding the total load of subjectively experienced crises in life there is no statistically significant difference between the age groups up to age,12,Widowhood,1.0
"74. Note that even if we compare the oldest respondents with the youngest, we find nothing but minor differences in the total crisis load. The most straightforward explanation to this finding is probably, as above men- tioned, the simple fact that each age has its own types of crises. Regardless of which explanations we propose, the finding could be regarded as an- other piece of evidence against the notion of old age as an abyss of stress and crises, particularly if we allow people themselves to determine if an event has been a crisis or not.",12,Widowhood,1.0
"A gender difference is that women systematically report more crises in life than men. This parallels other similar findings. For example, in most studies where respondents are asked directly if they feel lonely, female respondents report more loneliness than male respondents (Borys & Perlman, 1985). In an attempt to explain this difference, Torn- stam (1992b) empirically tested several possible hypotheses ranging from omission errors among men to women’s reduced self-esteem and unful- filled expectations of marriage. None of these hypotheses were confirmed. The study could only confirm that women report more loneliness then men, with the interesting qualification that this difference only existed among married or cohabiting men and women. In the case of crises in life, we have found the opposite pattern. The gender difference is only found among respondents who are separated, widowed, or never married. Among respondents who are married or cohabiting there is no gender difference in reported life crises.",36,Crises,0.4912086968604211
"These findings may seem contradictory but could be comprehensible theoretically with the hypothesis that women, by nature or due to a socially constructed gender role, are more vulnerable both in marriage or cohabitation, and outside these settings. If we focus on gender differ- ences in vulnerability rather than civil status, it would make sense that this higher female vulnerability expresses itself differently in different",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"When it comes to the gerotranscendence-crisis relationship, a main result of our analysis is that there certainly is a connection between crises in life and cosmic transcendence. Interpreted in a causal developmental way, the data support the assumption that crises in life may induce higher degrees of cosmic transcendence. This is, of course, not a conclusion to be drawn on the basis of cross-sectional data only, but since the result of the above analysis parallels what was found in the earlier qualitative and quantitative studies, this interpretation bears more weight. Drawing on the parallels between earlier results and the present data, we allow our- selves some tentative interpretations, which, in reality, go far beyond what can be inferred from a cross-sectional analysis.",47,Reminiscence,1.0
"As mentioned, a correlation exists between crises and cosmic tran- scendence, but this correlation decreases with age, as shown in both Table",46,Cosmic,1.0
"4.12 and Figures 4.11 and 4.12. A possible interpretation is that, with increasing age, crises have less power to induce cosmic transcendence. This is so because among respondents who had not experienced any crises, the degree of cosmic transcendence increased more rapidly with age. Another way of interpreting this pattern is that aging per se reduces or buffers against the impact of crises on cosmic transcendence. Aging itself becomes more important for the development of cosmic transcendence. There is, however, an important gender difference in this regard. Among women who had experienced crises, aging as such seems less important, especially in comparison with men who had not experienced any crises. Although it is an oversimplification, we might say that, for women, crises are relatively more important for the development of cosmic tran-",11,Cosmic,1.0

"The analysis has also revealed a connection between the experience of crises and coherence in life. Also in this case, aging seems to reduce the impact of crises. When young, a crisis in life reduces the feeling of coherence considerably. When old, a crisis in life doesn’t seem to reduce the feeling of coherence to the same degree. Also, in the end, individuals who had experienced crises reported almost the same feeling of coherence as those who had not. We suggest that they do so because their develop- mental pattern is faster. The experience of crises reduces the feeling of coherence in life at the same time as it accelerates the developmental process towards coherence.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"The need for solitude also shows a pattern in which aging seems to reduce the impact of crises, at least among men. If we regard the “development” at the end of the age scale (Figure 4.14), we see again that the need for solitude is almost the same regardless of whether the respondent has experienced a crisis or not.",162,Solitude,0.7536729021590673
Summing Up,156,65,1.0
"The pattern of subjectively defined crises in life differs partly between age groups. Some crises are life cycle defined, e.g., divorce and a person’s own disease, while others cut across the whole age span, e.g., another person’s disease or death. This contributes to the fact that the total load of subjectively experienced life crises is almost the same regardless of age. However, widowed, separated, or never married women of all ages, reported more crises than men in the same situation.",12,Widowhood,0.7772783440691967
"Subjectively experienced crises in life seem to contribute to the devel- opment of cosmic transcendence, especially among women. With increas- ing age the impact of crises is weakened. Among men, aging per se, relatively speaking, has a more powerful impact on cosmic transcendence. The feeling of coherence and the need for solitude are negatively affected by the experience of life crises. But, with a developmental perspec- tive, these negative impacts seem to subside with age.

THE FUNCTIONS OF REMINISCENCE ON GEROTRANSCENDENCE,39,Reminiscence,0.9775046881739691
"Drawing on the Erikson developmental theory, reminiscence—looking back at the life lived—can be understood as a way of integrating the elements of the past in order to restore and stabilize the identity. In fact, reminiscence, from such a perspective, is a backward process which aims at creating a sense of coherence in the life lived—within the same old construction on the world as before. The theory of gerotranscendence, on the other hand, opens the possibility that reminiscence might contribute to reorganization and change of the identity. In the following we will take a closer look at the functions of reminiscence. In particular we are inter- ested to see if reminiscence has functions other than that of stabilizing",110,Reminiscence,1.0
"and already developed identity. Could it perhaps sometimes play an instru- mental role in a developmental change and reconstruction of not only the identity, but also the way we distinguish reality—a function in line with the theory of gerotranscendence?",110,Reminiscence,0.836364261412211
The Reminiscence Perspective in Gerontology,79,Reminiscence,1.0
"Ever since Butler (1963) introduced the life review concept in gerontology, there has been a growing interest in its offspring: reminiscence theory and reminiscence therapy. Considerable effort has been made to classify, organize, and theoretically explain what reminiscence is, and there is an ongoing debate as to whether or not reminiscence has anything to do with aging (Cohen & Taylor, 1998). As suggested by Webster (1995), the occurrence of reminiscence might be determined by gender and per- sonality rather than by age.",79,Reminiscence,0.6180872437473608
"Despite this uncertainty, reminiscence therapy for the elderly has become very popular and is also considered to be quite successful (Com- ana & Brown, 1998; Puentes, 1998). In terms of theoretical orientation, most of the contemporary writings on the topic, as described by Parker (1995), are based on a continuity perspective. The assumption is that reminiscence therapy is successful because it helps to maintain and stabilize the identity. For example, according to Parker (1995), when reminiscence occurs in times of stress and strain its function is to stabilize the identity. Thus, in this perspective, the occurrence of increased reminiscence in times of stress is an indication of the continuity function of reminiscence.",79,Reminiscence,0.733589710634067
"In summary, then, we find that underlying many of the approaches to the question of reminiscence is the assumption that it serves to stabilize the identity for people in need. These people are sometimes, but not necessarily, elderly.",79,Reminiscence,1.0
"We would, however, like to suggest another possible theoretical perspective on this issue. The success of reminiscence might not always be related to continuity, but instead to just the opposite. Reminiscence might sometimes contribute to the change and reconstruction not only of the identity, but also of the very way in which we understand reality. It might be part of a process of reorganization and reconstruction—a process focused on change rather than stability. It might even be the case that the function of reminiscence changes during the life course—from identity stabilization in the early years, to the change and reconstruction of how we define reality later in life.",77,Reminiscence,1.0
"When Erikson’s developmental theory is used as the basis for under- standing reminiscence (Carlson, 1984; Castelnuovo-Tedesco, 1978; Taft & Nehrke, 1990), the process of remembering might in a limited way be understood in the perspective of change and reconstruction. The Erikson approach, however, basically refers to a possible change of the perception of the self, within the same old ontology, cosmology or “metaworld” as before. The entire definition of reality is not changed, only the definition of elements of the past life.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"As we have argued, the theory of gerotranscendence goes further—by suggesting a developmental process including ontological changes in the comprehension of the world and the self and by describing human devel- opment towards maturity and wisdom. Understanding the functions of reminiscence in this perspective allows us to relate reminiscence not only to identity and life course reconstruction, but also to more extensive changes in the ontological definitions of existence.",110,Reminiscence,1.0
Reminiscence from the Perspective of Gerotranscendence,39,Reminiscence,0.9897328579092629
"Simply put, gerotranscendence implies a transcendental shift in metaper- spective. This shift seems to be gradual, starting in early adulthood and normally reaching its peak in old age. Under certain conditions, however, even young individuals can reach a high level of gerotranscendence. We have in a previous section shown that life crises can, particularly for younger individuals, function as catalysts in this respect.",102,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"According to the initial qualitative study previously described in this book, the gerotranscendent individual typically experiences a new understanding of fundamental existential questions—often a feeling of cosmic communion with the spirit of the universe, a redefinition of time, space, life, and death, and a redefinition of the self and relationships to others. The individual becomes, for example, less preoccupied with self and at the same time more selective in his/her choice of social and other activities. There is an increased feeling of affinity with past generations, a decreased interest in superfluous social interaction and the positive solitude becomes more important.",37,Gerotranscendence,0.7457834595214969
"From such a perspective, reminiscence could be understood as part of a reconstruction process, rather than as an instrument used to stabilize old conceptions of identity and the world. In this way, the theory of gerotranscendence certainly differs from Erikson’s (1950, 1982) model of personal development. In both cases, aging is regarded as a developmental process that, at very best, ends with a higher state of maturity. Also, in",110,Reminiscence,1.0
"both cases, the mature state includes a new form of contentment and a new feeling of affinity with past generations. However, according to Erikson’s theory, ego-integration primarily refers to the integration and possible reconstruction of elements from the life that has passed. The individual reaches a fundamental acceptance of the life lived, regardless of how it might be viewed from the outside. In this way, the ego-integrity described by Erikson is more a process of backward integration taking place within the same world view, whereas the process of gerotranscen- dence implies a more forward or outwardly directed process, including a redefinition of reality. Thus, from the perspective of gerotranscendence, reminiscence might become part of a much larger reorganization and reconstruction process than is implied by Erikson’s developmental theory. The previously described empirical studies have shown that such developmental changes seem to take place and are associated not only with aging as such, but are also affected by social-matrix factors and incident-impact factors like gender and experienced crises in life.

"Additive indices have also been used for the measurement of diseases and life crises. Here we remind that the respondents were asked to read a list of common diseases and mark the diseases they were suffering from at the moment. The number of diseases were added to create a simple index. In the same vein, the respondents were asked if, during the last two years, they had experienced something they regarded as a life crisis.

The scores on the conversation function of reminiscence does not differ between men and women in any age category.",10,Reminiscence,1.0
Gerotranscendence and Reminiscence,39,Reminiscence,1.0
"As mentioned, the distinguishing qualities of cosmic transcendence are re- spondents’ feelings of connection with the whole of the universe, feelings of being part of everything alive, the tendency to feel a strong presence of persons who are elsewhere, the tendency to feel as if they were living in the past and present simultaneously, and a strong feeling of connection with earlier generations. Our thesis is that reminiscence might be part of the gerotranscendental change, and might therefore play an instrumen- tal role in this process. In the case of cosmic transcendence, this implies a change in the very way in which we understand our whole being. But what is the specific role of reminiscence in gerotranscendence? There are three alternatives. First, reminiscence might be regarded as promoter or “cause” of gerotranscendence. Second, gerotranscendence might be regarded as the “cause” of changes in reminiscence functions. Third, both reminiscence and gerotranscendence might be part of the same entity.",39,Reminiscence,0.3862508827602175
"Table 4.15 summarizes an ANOVA-MCA analysis in which cosmic transcendence is regarded as the dependent variable. This analysis shows that the unity and identity reminiscence functions are the two variables that, together with pure age, are able to predict cosmic transcendence better than others. Each one of these two variables has a substantial positive explanatory power even when other variables are controlled for.95 The conversation reminiscence, however, which initially has a significant positive correlation with cosmic transcendence, loses its explanatory power when the other variables are controlled for.",31,Reminiscence,0.6801956058719395
"If we accept the assumption of the causal order where reminiscence precedes cosmic transcendence, we can conclude that unity reminiscence and identity reminiscence seem to positively affect the degree of cosmic transcendence, while conversation reminiscence does not.96",31,Reminiscence,0.6668270651094571
"However, the second assumption of the causal order between cosmic transcendence and reminiscence is the one where cosmic transcendence precedes reminiscence. Table 4.16 summarizes the outcome of three ANOVA-MCA analyses, one for each of the reminiscence dimensions. In these analyses, reminiscence is regarded as the dependent variable.",31,Reminiscence,0.6801956058719395
"As possible independent variables related to the alternative reasons for reminiscence, we have introduced the experience of cosmic transcendence together with age, gender, the experience of crises, illness, and life satisfac- tion. The latter variables have previously been shown to be empirically related to the experience of cosmic transcendence and, thus, have to be included in the analysis.",31,Reminiscence,1.0
"As can be seen from Table 4.16 (and from Table 4.15), the bivariate correlations (eta values) between the cosmic transcendence scale and the reminiscence dimensions are quite strong. They are, in fact, the strongest of all the possible independent variables. Moreover, these strong correla- tions remain (as beta values) after the introduction of the other indepen- dent variables. The explanatory power of crises, illness, and life satisfaction are, on the other hand, generally much lower, especially after the introduc- tion of other independent variables. The exception is the explanatory power of experience of crises, which still has a remaining explanatory power on the identity function of reminiscence. This is still, however, less than half the explanatory power of cosmic transcendence.",31,Reminiscence,0.618846124086562
"Without going into details, Table 4.16 could be summarized as follows: First, that cosmic transcendence appears to be related to reminis- cence, even when variables like age, gender, crises, etc., are controlled for. Second, age, even when other independent variables are controlled for, also explains a good deal of the variation in reasons for reminiscence. Gender explains some of the variance in the unity function, but little or none of the variation in the identity or conversation functions. Third, the “stress variables” are more or less washed out as explanatory variables when the other independent variables are introduced into the analysis. This contradicts the suggestion by Parker (1995) that reminiscence should be understood primarily as a stabilizing reaction in times of stress and",31,Reminiscence,1.0
"strain. To support this latter interpretation of reminiscence, we should have obtained the highest beta values for crises and illness, while the beta values for cosmic transcendence and age would have been minimal.",31,Reminiscence,1.0
"Another way of using Table 4.16 is to ask which variables should be used if we want to predict who will use reminiscence for purposes of unity, identity or conversation. A person who uses reminiscence for the purpose of creating unity of existence is, then, likely to be a transcendent elderly woman. The person who uses reminiscence for identity purposes is likely to be a transcendent younger individual who has experienced life crises during the last year. The user of reminiscence for conversation purposes is likely to be a transcendent older person. These category descriptions have been confirmed by CHAID analyses; thus, precisely the above mentioned categories were produced by the CHAID algorithm.",10,Reminiscence,1.0
"The third interpretation of the correlations between the cosmic di- mension of gerotranscendence and the dimensions of reminiscence is that they are part of the same entity, rather than existing in a cause-effect relationship. In order to test this hypothesis, we have done a factor analysis with all the items of cosmic transcendence and all the items of the three dimensions of reminiscence in one and the same explorative factor analysis. If the concept of cosmic transcendence and the dimensions of reminis- cence were part of the same entity, we would expect the items from the cosmic gerotranscendence dimension and the items from the reminiscence dimensions to mix. However, they do not. The analysis simply reproduces the three functional dimensions of reminiscence and a separate dimension of cosmic transcendence. Thus, we have support for the assumption that the concepts represent different entities involved in some kind of causal relationship. In Table 4.15, we made the assumption that the different aspects of reminiscence are supportive to the development of cosmic transcendence. The reverse assumption is in theory, however, also reason- able, as presumed in Table 4.16.",31,Reminiscence,0.27343955986921437
Conclusions about Reminiscence,77,Reminiscence,1.0
"In this section, we have theoretically connected the functions of reminis- cence with the theory of gerotranscendence. This also made it empirically possible to say something about the functions of reminiscence in a devel- opmental perspective. Our data suggest that the functions of reminiscence change with age such that, roughly speaking, the unity of existence function becomes more important with age. Therefore, our results both deviate",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"from and agree with what has been summarized by Cohen and Taylor (1998). They report that reminiscence studies normally do not show any age differences unless we consider specific life-stage-related tasks or problems. The function of “boredom reduction” is, for example, consid- ered to be more prevalent among young people, whereas “death prepara- tion” is considered to be more prevalent among the old.",10,Reminiscence,1.0
"Our analysis, however, shows that the unity of existence function grows continuously with age, suggesting that this is related to a developmental identity process, rather than to any stage-dependent tasks. The almost linear age slope indicates this.",10,Reminiscence,0.8971010060680789
"The identity function of reminiscence, on the other hand, seems to be more stage-specific. It peaks at age category 25–34, drops to a low at age category 55–64 and thereafter increases marginally again. The identity function of reminiscence however seems to be most important during young age.",10,Reminiscence,1.0
"One question about reminiscence, treated in the introduction, is whether it should be regarded as instrumental for change or for continuity.

"Even if our data do provide some very weak evidence that situations of stress (life crises in particular) might stimulate the identity function of reminiscence, this can not be taken as support for the continuity hypothe- sis. Since the crisis-induced identity function of reminiscence appears in connection with cosmic transcendence97—which implies change and reor- ganization—it must be interpreted in the same way, in terms of change and reorganization. In other words, our data indicate that the reminiscence induced by a crisis is more likely to contribute to identity reorganization and reconstruction than to identity preservation. Last, but not least, the phenom- ena of gerotranscendence and reminiscence are, according to our analyses, intertwined. The concepts are separate, but they appear together.",47,Reminiscence,0.6909559373339275
"If these conclusions are correct, then they have implications for practical reminiscence work. One such implication is that, since the unity of existence function of reminiscence becomes more important with age, reminiscence work with the elderly should focus more on that dimension. Another implication is that, since the functions of reminiscence seem",10,Reminiscence,1.0

NURSING STAFF’S INTERPRETATIONS OF GEROTRANSCENDENCE-RELATED BEHAVIOR,30,Gerotranscendental,1.0
"The theory of gerotranscendence identifies a number of “signs” of gero- transcendence, accounted for in detail in the chapter on the qualitative content of gerotranscendence. These signs include, for example, changes in the definitions of time and space, body-transcendence, ego-integrity, and emancipated innocence. These signs are evident in certain behaviors and attitudes that might be observable by, for example, nursing staff.",30,Gerotranscendental,0.9567534726447656
"In order to find out if staff members working with the elderly notice such behaviors and how they interpret them, we have, in a special study, presented a number of care givers with descriptions of specific behaviors and asked if they have noticed these behaviors among the old people they care for. When such behaviors were recognized, we asked for the staff members’ interpretations of these behaviors and deconstructed the inter- pretations. As we will show in this section, a common denominator in the interpretations of “gerotranscendental behaviors” is that they are constructed within the scope of the theories the nursing staff are familiar with. This means that the pathology perspective is most frequent and the behaviors are understood as symptoms of, for example, dementia.",30,Gerotranscendental,1.0

"dementia, depression, or drug use, rather than part of a positive develop- ment towards wisdom and maturation.

"The question, thus, is which perspective we take, consciously or unconsciously, when we are confronted with behaviors that we here call “gerotranscendental.” This is an even more interesting question as regards the perspectives taken by nursing staff, since different perspectives also imply different ways of reacting to these behaviors. When we interpret a certain behavior as pathological, we react differently than when we interpret the same behavior as a development towards wisdom and matu- rity. The interactive identity-shaping process might, thus, take very differ- ent paths depending on whether “gerotranscendental behaviors” are regarded as signs of pathology or signs of a positive developmental process.",30,Gerotranscendental,1.0

"The interviewees in a first study (1998) on how staff members interpret gerotranscendental behavior were some nurses and care aides99 working in a Swedish service house for the elderly. Staff members in these catego- ries have the most frequent contact with the service house residents. This particular Swedish service house is for relatively healthy elderly people who are, nevertheless, in need of access to daily care due to their frailty. This house is formally classified as independent living, but there are common facilities like a restaurant, therapy, and 24-hour staff. The resi- dents are, however, encouraged to live as independently as possible.",30,Gerotranscendental,0.6674743458947665
"Each of the staff members was interviewed using a semistructured qualitative approach. They were asked if they had noticed in the residents a series of behaviors, which we had derived from the theory of gerotrans- cendence. In cases of an affirmative response, they were then asked to interpret these behaviors. All of the interviews were tape recorded, re- viewed several times, and analyzed. The basic principle in the analysis was to deconstruct the interviews in order to decide whether or not the answers could be related to any of the interpretative perspectives outlined above.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"In a few interviews, this “behavior” was attributed to defense mecha- nisms triggered by lost security, inactivity, or just aging decline. In short, all of the interviewees noticed the transcendence of time borders, and the cardinal qualitative interpretation of this was within the framework of a negative pathological perspective. Of course this phenomenon can be, and sometimes is, a symptom of a beginning dementia, but from our analyses we know that perfectly healthy individuals also experience this transcendence of time.

Increased Need for Solitude,6,Solitude,1.0
"According to the theory of gerotranscendence, the individual redefines the importance of social relationships in such a way that he/she becomes more selective, prefers one-on-one communication to more superficial contacts with many, and experiences an increased need for solitude.

"To sum up, all of the interviewees had noticed the decreased need for social interaction and the increased need for solitude and tended to interpret this negatively. A withdrawal from social interaction was interpreted as a sign of loneliness and isolation, or as a sign of different pathological conditions. Withdrawing into solitude was regarded as a problem. Being socially active and participating in various social activities were described as desirable. Activity was regarded as very important for the well-being of the elderly. The underlying, activity theory perspective, was obvious. Also regarding the interpretation of the increasing need for solitude, the Wadensten and Carlsson (2001) study reached a similar result. The staff that they interviewed interpreted the increased need for solitude as a kind of defense reaction to losses of friends and close relatives, together with lack of energy to find new friends.",33,Loneliness,1.0

We can imagine that behind these statements lies an activity-oriented theoretical perspective. Such a per- spective can even be discerned in those statements in which elderly peo- ple’s tendency to shift their sources of pleasure is understood as a sign of resignation. This tendency was interpreted as a negative consequence of their social withdrawal. The interviewees felt that the way in which the elderly withdraw from social contact and spend more of their time alone constitutes a problem. The Wadensten and Carlsson (2001) study also showed that elderly people’s rejoicing in small events was interpreted negatively by the staff they interviewed.",4,Depression,0.5655107768407671

The interpretations are largely in line with Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development, which is taught in the curriculum of Swedish nurses and is therefore well- known.

At the same time they noticed that none of the staff reported to have observed that older people looking back upon their lives claimed to understand events and episodes in a new light or as reaching a new, mature state of coherence. This latter finding can of course be due to the fact that none of the old people these staff have met, had talked about their lives in this reconstructive manner.

In some statements, elderly people’s de- creased interest in material things is described in terms of priorities: The elderly place more value on the nonmaterial. In a couple of statements, this was interpreted as a result of aging, i.e., from a developmental perspec- tive. In an additional two statements, a theory of continuity could be discerned in the interpretations, i.e., such nonmaterialistic values are determined and secured earlier in life.

The modal observation by the staff, however, was that most elderly displayed rigidity rather than any developmental self-confronta- tion. The minority of staff members who reported observing self-confron- tation among the elderly interpreted this behavior in two different ways.

Here the interpretations focused on coping processes. The old people were said to have adapted to their bodily changes and accepted the fact that one changes. It was also argued that those who have led good lives may find it easier to accept difficulties (like bodily changes). So, the “normality” here was not a normality in any developmental perspective, but rather the normality of having the capacity to cope with stress and strain.",87,Normality,1.0

"According to the theory of gerotranscendence, having everyday wisdom may be part of a gerotranscendental development. Everyday wisdom was defined as the tendency to be broadminded as opposed to condemning in one’s attitudes. The common attitude among the staff members was that most elderly people are more condemning than broadminded, but some staff members did describe cases of “everyday wisdom.” Their inter- pretations, however, could not be placed within any of the theoretical perspectives mentioned above. Wadensten and Carlsson (2001) also re- ported on the invisibility of everyday wisdom and of stubbornness and self-confidence as being the norm.

Our assumption was that these interpretations and discourses can be related—explicitly or implicitly—to certain theoretical perspectives which might be familiar to the staff. In particular, a) the pathology perspective, b) activity theory, c) disengagement theory, e) continuity theory, and d) developmental theory.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"A general observation is that there are certain behaviors that the staff members hardly noticed at all. An example of this is “everyday wisdom,” which most of the interviewees did not observe in the elderly they cared for. Of course, this could mean that the interviewees have not met with this phenomenon in their everyday reality, but another just as likely explanation is that the nursing staff’s frames of reference cannot accommo- date these types of observations. The everyday discourse of these care givers is constructed using specific theoretical building blocks. This simul- taneously creates keen-sightedness in certain directions and blindness in others. This can help us understand why some gerotranscendendental behaviors were hardly observed at all by the staff. In addition to everyday wisdom, this also means blindness to self-transcendence, self-confronta- tion, body transcendence, and, in one of the studies, the disappearing fear of death. Instead of stating that these behaviors just were not there, we suggest they possibly might have been, but that staff had no preparation to observe them. But, to be sure, gerotranscendence is not reached by everyone, so the presence of some signs may actually be rare. At the same time, having cared for old people for many years would likely have enabled the staff members to observe gerotranscendental behaviors in at least some individuals.",30,Gerotranscendental,0.8430997222900402
"In cases where the interviewees did notice gerotranscendental behav- iors, the results clearly reveal the diversity of perceptions as defined in terms of recognized theories, i.e., the same behavior is interpreted differ- ently by different people. The least common denominator, however, is that a majority of the interpretations—whether direct or indirect—were made within the perspective of activity theory or in pathology-oriented terms. This would seem to indicate that nursing staff members’ perceptual fields are largely distinguished and limited by pathology-oriented and activity-oriented theoretical points of departure. This does not, of course, place any blame on staff members. It is, instead, an example of how reality is constructed and defined in terms of the frames of reference at hand.",30,Gerotranscendental,0.8941619780509856
"In those interpretations that seem to reflect an underlying activity- oriented theoretical understanding of aging, the various behaviors were associated with both negative and positive meanings. In the case of positive meanings, the behavior in question was interpreted as a positive expression of an active and outgoing life. In the case of more negative interpretations, the “problem behaviors” were interpreted as signs or causes of loneliness, inactivity, isolation, passivity, or various pathological conditions. Overall,",116,Interpretations,0.9844660562941732
gerotranscendental behaviors tended to be understood as the undesirable consequences of loneliness and inactivity.,8,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"Frames of reference other than activity theory were also clearly displayed in staff members’ interpretations of the behaviors they observed. A recurring theme was understanding based on continuity theory. The behaviors in question are, thus, described as being dependent on the personality and lifestyle characteristics of a continuous, lifelong pattern. Additional interpretations of observed behavior are informed by more intuitive, developmentally oriented reasoning. Interpretations within this frame of reference are marked by the fact that they are not focused on problems; on the contrary, the behaviors are associated with positive meanings. As regards those behaviors we have called return to childhood, ego-integrity, and disappearing fear of death, it has been possible to refer to Erikson’s developmental model, which is well-known to most people working with the elderly. In keeping with Erikson, the interviewees have been able to associate the behaviors in question with positive meanings. On the other hand, as regards behaviors categorized as transcendence of time, increasing need for solitude, and rejoicing in small events, no “posi- tive” frames of reference have been available. Interpretations of these behaviors have, thereby, fallen into the more “negative” and pathology-",116,Interpretations,0.9044988452986722
oriented frames of references that the staff members have at hand.,13,Staff,1.0
"Since we maintain that gerotranscendence describes something that is, at least for some people, a positive development, the above studies would seem to indicate that care givers working with the elderly need more theoretical knowledge about alternative frames of reference. If care givers were more aware of the existence of different theories, a broader understanding of how different individuals can age in a positive way would be facilitated. This, in turn, would lead to an increase in the quality of the care currently offered to elderly people.",126,Elderly,1.0
THE IMPACT OF THE THEORY ON NURSING STAFF,1,Nursing,1.0
"In the previous section studies were presented where staff members were shown to know nothing about gerotranscendence and, in fact, often were prone to classify gerotranscendendental behavior as pathological, since this followed from the theoretical frameworks that were familiar to them— consciously or unconsciously. But what happens if nursing staff come to know about gerotranscendence?",30,Gerotranscendental,1.0
"This section describes an attempt to introduce the theory of gerotran- scendence to nursing staff. The venture included two steps: 1) the intro- duction of the theory, and 2) six months later, an impact evaluation. As will be described below, the impact evaluation showed that almost half of the staff came to a new understanding of specific care recipients after learning about the theory of gerotranscendence, and that a third of the staff also changed their attitude towards caring for specific individuals. The introduction of the new theory also reduced staff members’ feelings of guilt about insufficiency at work.",78,Gerotranscendence,1.0
The Intervention Group and the Intervention,26,Meetings,0.720286457552972
"The intervention took place in the small Swedish rural municipality, Essunga. In this municipality, the total nursing staff working with the elderly in various institutional settings consisted of approximately 100 women, which allowed a nearly full-scale intervention. The intervention was primarily aimed at staff working at institutions for the elderly, but a few staff from the open community service also wished to participate and were included in the intervention.100",26,Meetings,1.0
"The introduction of the theory included some creative participation on the part of the staff. Instead of presenting them with a ready-made care model, the idea was to build on staff members’ experiences. In choosing this approach, we diverged from a classic experimental design, where the manipulation is totally controlled by the researcher.",1,Nursing,1.0
"The introduction phase took place during the period October 1993 to March 1994 and started with a half-day seminar. During this seminar, ways of understanding and caring for the elderly were presented and discussed. Along with the more or less familiar perspectives offered by activity theory, continuity theory, and ordinary developmental theory, the theory of gerotranscendence was introduced to the staff and discussed in small subgroups where each subgroup included staff of different profes- sions and from different settings. The discussions aimed at promoting",126,Elderly,0.7428130815515522

"As noted, the research strategy can expose us to some criticism. Since the staff in the “experimental group” has, at least to some extent, helped to define the impact dimensions, the manipulation is not clean. If, how- ever, we understand that this study is not a classical experiment, but rather an inventive process in which the staff has participated, it makes sense to study the outcome of this process. This type of study would, in fact, be impossible to carry out within the methodological frame of the classical experiment.

"101A technical remark about the data analysis is appropriate at this point. As a full-scale interven- tion, principally including all staff, the intervention might be regarded as rather extensive. However, when it comes to the analysis of the quantitative data from the impact survey, the data set is very small—in fact, much too small for the more elaborate analyses we would like to do. Thus, we must make the interpretations with caution. On the other hand, since the data reflect a full-scale intervention, there has been no statistical sampling procedure and an orthodox interpretation of the statistical rules of the game would say that we have no reason to make any probability calculations. Despite this, we have supplied probability calculations in the analyses to follow. We did this under the assumption that some readers might wish to regard the intervention group as a sample from a larger population, e.g., defined as “Swedish municipal staff working with the elderly?. The probability measures are all based on Chi-square. The coefficients of association are Eta correlations, allowing nominal data. Regarding the circum- stances, however, the reader is advised to pay more attention to the magnitude of the Eta measures than to the probability calculations.",27,Impact,0.7738888954460842

Familiarity with the Theory Seemed to Reduce Feelings of Insufficiency at Work,1,Nursing,1.0
"During the group discussions, members of the staff suggested that the theory of gerotranscendence might help to reduce feelings of insufficiency at work by, among other things, presenting an intelligible view of care recipients’ increased need for solitude.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"A question related to this suggestion is: What proportion of the staff reports such feelings of insufficiency at work and to what extent are these feelings related to general job dissatisfaction and/or particular environ- mental factors? In relation to this question, staff members were asked whether they liked their work tasks, place of work, and colleagues, and if they had feelings of guilt or insufficiency at work.",50,Guilt,1.0

"Even if the staff in this study reported a high degree of satisfaction with their jobs, there was, as expected, one important indicator signaling a special problem. No less then 81 percent of the respondents stated that they, to a high or certain degree, have feelings of insufficience at work and/or guilt about being insufficient. In this case we found no differences between subgroups of different ages, or from different professions or work settings. Also, regardless of how many years the respondents had been working, the feelings of insufficiency remained the same. The feel- ings of guilt about insufficiency cut through all the professional categories in the study. Since it is most likely that these categories are subject to different workloads and care burdens, the workload hypothesis is probably not a good explanation of the high proportions of staff suffering from feelings of guilt and/or insufficiency. A possible explanation is that these feelings of insufficiency are based on something different, i.e., that they are based on approaches to care that are rooted in inaccurate and inefficient theories about the aging process. In short, the feelings of guilt and insuffi- ciency might be due to not having the proper tools in the theoretical toolbox. Might this be solved by the introduction of a new frame of reference as offered by the theory of gerotranscendence—that is, by adding a new theoretical tool to the tool box? Table 5.2 reveals that 45 percent of the staff reported that the theory of gerotranscendence helped, to a “certain” or “high” degree, to reduce feelings of guilt about insufficiency.",50,Guilt,1.0
"Table 5.3 shows that respondents’ ages correlated with the degree of guilt reduction. Thus, the older the respondent, the more the theory was reported to have reduced guilt. We also found a strong correlation between work setting and guilt reduction.

The Overall Impact,27,Impact,0.8268755150419645

"For each respondent, we counted the number of times the respondent reported that the theory of gerotranscendence had an impact, to a “cer- tain” or “high” degree, in the following five areas: 1) Did the staff think the theory had any basis in reality? 2) Did the theory have an impact on the staff’s outlook on their own old age? 3) Did the theory help the staff to understand care recipients in a new light? 4) Did the theory change staff’s approach to care giving? 5) Did the theory help to reduce any feelings of insufficiency or guilt at work?",78,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"From the construction of the index, it follows that its range is between zero and five. The mean number of “impacts” was 2.03, which simply means that, on average, the respondents reported 2.03 areas in which the theory had an impact.",27,Impact,0.660873292311643
"From Table 5.3 we can see that the deviations from this average, expressed by the correlation coefficients, are apparent.

The better the theory was understood, the stronger the impact.",27,Impact,0.5962993447350393
"More interesting was the equally strong correlation between the general-impact index and the work setting. Behind the correlation of .47 is the pattern we have earlier observed. The impact was at its lowest among staff at nursing homes, who reported an average of 1.2 areas of impact. Staff at old age homes reported 2.3 areas of impact, and staff at group dwellings, 2.5 areas of impact. Staff in the community home service, finally, reported an average of 3.4 areas of impact. Furthermore, regarding professional status, the pattern is by now well-known: registered nurses reported the highest number of impact areas (3.3), and enrolled nurses the lowest (1.6).",1,Nursing,0.5727910664668483
Conclusions About Educating Staff in Gerotranscendence,78,Gerotranscendence,0.9877173375699356
"After a six-month latency period the theory of gerotranscendence was recognized as a theory describing relevant parts of the reality staff mem- bers meet in their work with certain elderly care recipients. High propor- tions of the staff not only understood the theory, but also held the opinion that it corresponded to the reality they knew as professional care givers. Also, nearly half of the staff reported that they gained new insights into specific care recipients in light of the theory.",78,Gerotranscendence,0.9877173375699356

"nurses reported understanding of the theory and cases which fit the theory more frequently while, among settings, staff working in nursing homes reported less impact and applicability of the intervention. They had, for example, more difficulties understanding the theory and recognizing gerotranscendent care recipients. There can be several explanations for this finding. One of them is that the environment in a nursing home is rather hospital-like and may be inappropriate for the application of the theory of gerotranscendence; physical rather than spiritual well-being is the primary focus. Another explanation might be that in nursing homes several of the patients may be suffering from true dementia and thus are outside the scope of the theory’s applicability.",26,Meetings,0.41955035317866435
"Two comments can be made on this, one trivial and one important. The trivial comment is that if there are no gerotranscendent individuals present, you cannot recognize any. The important comment is that gerotrans- cendent individuals are probably not totally absent from nursing homes, they are probably just fewer in number. At the same time, the nursing home environment and existing evaluative frameworks make it more difficult for them to be seen. If gaining new understanding of care recipients was relatively com- mon based on our interviews, the logically subsequent changes in caring practices were more unusual. One third of the staff became better listeners and more permissive, while almost none introduced new developmental stimuli. It is quite obvious that the intervention must be more powerful if we want to reach the ultimate goal of modification of care practices. Even if the desired behavioral changes were hardly reached with this intervention, the outcome was unexpectedly positive in many respects. One positive",26,Meetings,0.6296283805788802
finding was the guilt-reducing capacity of the theory.,1,Nursing,1.0
"The reduction in guilt, however, highlighted yet another problem. There was a minority (10 percent) of the respondents who, to a “certain” or “high” degree, saw an ethical problem connected with the theory. Qualitatively, the ethical problem was described as follows: “Who decides what to do, I and the care recipient or the relatives?” Prior to this interven- tion, the staff had a problem—relatives often wanted more activation and more active care than care recipients themselves desired. Application of the new theory would seem to magnify this problem. The feeling of guilt about insufficiency in relation to the care recipient seems to be reduced, but perhaps substituted by the problem with the relatives of the care recipients. It may be that staff members are not the only ones who need to know about gerotranscendence, but relatives as well.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

Each focus group attended a lecture on the theory of gerotranscendence, after which they participated in a group discussion aiming at finding which kind of actions and components of care could promote development towards gerotrans- cendence or what might constitute good care for people already ap- proaching gerotranscendence. The participants in the focus groups also were asked for procedures, activities, or behaviors to omit in order not to counteract the processes of gerotranscendence. Each “sign” of gerotran- scendence was discussed in the focus groups in order to reach practical guidelines for recognizing all the aspects and behaviors characteristic of gerotranscendence.

"The above guidelines were produced after an analysis of existing nursing theories in which Wadensten and Carlsson (2002, 2003a) made the follow- ing observation that nursing theories offer no practical guidelines when it comes to the care of older people:",81,Guidelines,0.8022483347637556
"Nursing theorists take individuality in care into consideration and men- tion the importance of structuring nursing on the basis of each individu- al’s needs. This is a basic assumption, regarding individuals as people with unique wishes. However, these theories might also appear to be too general, because they do not discuss specific needs of older people; instead they seem to be age-blind. The present guidelines, in contrast, focus on older people, the aging process and ideas about how to support older people’s individual development, which is something that nursing theorists have not taken into consideration. Many have adopted a relatively clear devel- opmental perspective in their theories, but have not provided practical guidelines for care of older people. Therefore, the present guidelines serve to fill a gap, and show what might be of special interest in the care of older people. (Wadensten & Carlsson, 2002, p. 469)",81,Guidelines,1.0
"Wadensten and Carlsson (2002) came to the conclusion that if staff mem- bers are to adopt guidelines like those described above, the first prerequi- site is knowledge about the theory and the guidelines. It is also necessary to work with a supporting organization. Finally, there is need for training to achieve the guidelines in practical work. The mere knowledge of the theory and the guidelines is not enough for adherence. A guided and promoted intervention is needed and has been undertaken by Wadensten and Carlsson (2003b) in a “software innovation” based on the theory of gerotranscendence.",49,Adopters,0.8322278520699434

"wards. The staff members were introduced to the theory of gerotranscen- dence and were then given instructions on how to use the guidelines in relation to the residents. The aim of the experiment was to see to what extent the staff changed their interpretations of gerotranscendent behav- iors in the residents, and to what extent the staff members changed their own behavior, by adopting the guidelines. The authors were also interested to see whether individual staff members could be identified as “early adopters” versus “laggards.”",49,Adopters,1.0
"The intervention took place in a rather large Swedish city, at a nursing home with eight wards where two were randomly selected as experimental wards. Twenty-six residents lived on these two wards, which together had 18 staff members. After the introduction of the theory and the guidelines, the activities at the wards were followed by means of participant observation and interviews with staff and residents at several points in time.",26,Meetings,1.0
"Also in this intervention study the most distinct effect of the new “software” was increased listening and permissiveness on the part of staff members. Their post-intervention treatment of the residents included more acceptance of their behavior. When it came to the different groups of guidelines, it proved easier to adopt the guidelines that focused on individual meetings between staff members and residents. The guidelines focusing on new activities and the organization were more difficult to follow since the staff members, as they explained, lacked both the time and the experience to do so. They also explained that these latter tasks were not their duties.",26,Meetings,0.3522427996068216
"Wadensten and Carlsson (2003b) also made an effort to classify the staff members in the adapter categories described by Rogers (1995) in his innovation-theoretical model. The staff members categorized as early adopters described many of the gerotranscendental behaviors as normal from the very beginning and started promptly to follow the guidelines. Characteristic of these staff members was that they recognized in them- selves a personal development in line with the theory of gerotranscen- dence. They felt that they had developed and changed in connection with personal experiences, which had started developmental processes in line with the theory. Otherwise these staff members differed in age as well as in the degree of experience they had with elder care.",49,Adopters,1.0
The staff members belonging to the category labeled early majority adapted the guidelines without furthering them and without being pro- moters. They were younger than the staff members in the late majority and laggard categories and had less experience with elder care. The late,81,Guidelines,0.648665224270743
"majority category included staff members who changed their interpreta- tions of gerotranscendental behaviors from pathological to normal, but not their behavior. It was difficult to identify any common characteristics in this group, other than that they had a skeptical attitude. The most skeptical group, however, comprised the laggards. The staff members belonging to this category were not only skeptical of the theory, they impeded the intervention by avoiding participation in the lectures and group discussions. The common denominator for the staff members in this group was that they had a generally negative attitude towards their work. Their jobs were merely a livelihood rather than a profession. The distribution of the staff members over the adopter categories was close to a normal frequency distribution, with most of the staff members belong- ing to the early majority and fewer in the surrounding categories.",49,Adopters,0.33441594359531773
Wadensten and Carlsson (2003b) argue that the norms and structure of the organization are part of the success or failure of a venture like this. The above intervention focused primarily on individual staff members and not on the leadership role. The managers neither appeared to be engaged in the care nor were they involved in the promotion of the intervention process.,26,Meetings,1.0
"When venturing into an intervention like this, Wadensten and Carls- son (2003b) recommend trying to find the potential early adopters at an early phase of the project and trying to enlist their assistance. They might be able to influence other staff members, thereby facilitating the intervention process. Since the early adopters are those who from the very beginning feel aligned with the theory of gerotranscendence, it might be possible to identify them. The recommendation is also to try to identify the laggards as soon as possible, in order to possibly get them motivated to participate or, at the very least, reduce their negative influence on the rest of the group.",49,Adopters,0.472862895480147
Conclusions and Summary,15,Conclusions,0.35879275016285317
ere we should recall that the theory of gerotranscendence was born of a dissatisfaction with the mismatch between several common assumptions and the empirical findings within social,8,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"gerontology, e.g., the presumed retirement trauma and loneliness peak in old age. This led to the understanding that much of the theorizing within social gerontology has been directed by the special values held by middle-aged scholars in modern Western society, with its focus on success, productivity, effectiveness, and independence. We tend to project these values on old age as the norm, where divergences or developments away from these norms become “pathological” according to our predefined notions.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"In order reach a description of what kind of developmental changes this gerotranscendence process includes, we have listened to what those who have come far in such a development had to tell us.

"In the first quantitative study on the subject, the 1990 Danish retro- spective study, it was empirically confirmed that randomly selected older (74–100 years) people report on developmental changes in line with the ones described above. Thus, it must be accepted that a substantial propor- tion of real people do experience developmental changes in line with the theory of gerotranscendence. In this first quantitative study it was also shown that these experiences could not be explained away with reference to conditions of psychological strain, depression, mental insufficiency, or consumption of psychotropic medications, since the influence of such confounding factors was controlled for. The only conclusion in this regard was that consumption of psychotropic medications seemed to be a hin- drance to achieving gerotranscendence.",87,Normality,0.588440989454902

"from a developmental perspective, our data suggest that the development of cosmic transcendence and coherence are continuous processes which start already during the first half of adult life and gradually develop to their maximum in later life. The need for solitude also increases to a maximum in late life, but seems to develop most rapidly during the first half of adult life. It was also shown that at the upper end of the age scale, with more of cosmic transcendence (and coherence) comes more satisfaction with life. It seems that the combination of cosmic transcen- dence and enhanced life satisfaction is a combination especially reserved for old age.",167,Transcendence,1.0
"When considering the above conclusions we must again, however, make the reservation that the data on which we have built these conclu- sions and the ones that follow are limited in several ways, culturally, temporally, and, equally important, the fact that they are retrospective and cross-sectional, not longitudinal.",124,Sectional,0.7066147223213703
THE IMPACT OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN LIFE,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Cosmic transcendence is, according to the analysis, not only affected by aging as such, but also, when young and middle-aged, by life circum- stances—what we call social-matrix factors. Respondents with self-gov- erned professions and students score higher on cosmic transcendence. Maybe a life with higher degrees of autonomy contributes to a liberation from restrictive, mainstream rules and values which might otherwise have reduced the possibility for development of cosmic transcendence.",141,Entrepreneurs,1.0
"Being male or female also makes a difference when it comes to cosmic transcendence. In the age categories from 20 to 64, men score lower than women on cosmic gerotranscendence, but from 75 upwards, they have caught up with the women. There is some empirical support for the assumption that this has something to do with what many women experi- ence as a developmental crisis when giving birth to a child. Women without the experience of giving birth, score lower on cosmic transcen- dence. It is, in fact, shown that during young adulthood and middleage, life crises—which are incident-impact factors—positively contribute to the development of cosmic transcendence for both men and women. For men however, during young adulthood and middleage, age as such has twice as much explanatory power as the crises in terms of the impact on cosmic transcendence. For women, during young adulthood and mid-",5,Cosmic,0.8986644975258747
"dleage, age and crises have approximately the same amount of explanatory power. We could say that for women during young adulthood and mid- dleage, developmental crises are relatively more important for the devel- opment of cosmic transcendence, while aging as such is relatively more important for men. In late old age however, crise, as well as social-matrix factors seem to have lost their impact on the degree of cosmic transcendence for both men and women.",11,Cosmic,1.0
"Unlike cosmic transcendence, coherence, even at the upper end of the age scale, has several rather strong social-matrix and incident-impact predictors, of which the experiences of no crises, high activity, being married, and former qualified profession are the most important. When late old age is reached, the degree of experienced coherence seem to be equally determined by a) a pure positive age development, and b) social- matrix and incidence-impact factors, which might have either a positive or a negative impact on the degree of coherence.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"When it comes to the need for solitude, there seem to be two quite different causes. One cause seems to be solely related to age developmental change. With increasing age comes a greater need for positive solitude. The other cause is reactions to incident-impact factors like diseases and crises. As a reaction to these strains a negative solitude seeking comes in the form of withdrawal. Solitude seeking is, then, a coin with two sides—a positive one, which we regard as part of gerotranscendence, and a negative one, which is related to traditional defense reactions like withdrawal and avoidance.",-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"When it comes to incident impact factors—crises in life, as defined by the individual—these crises seem to produce, during young adulthood and middleage, both decreases in the experience of coherence and in- creased solitude seeking.

GEROTRANSCENDENCE IN PRACTICE,3,Gerotranscendence,0.9022432420451285
From two different studies we know that staff working with the elderly do recognize in old people many of the signs of gerotranscendence ac- counted for above. No less than 72 percent of the staff attested to the theory’s correspondence with the reality they meet in their work with elderly. The theory also helped 43 percent of the staff members to under-,126,Elderly,1.0
"stand specific care recipients in a new light, in particular care recipients who previously had been difficult to understand. Furthermore, 45 percent of the staff members felt that the theory had helped them to reduce feelings of insufficiency and/or guilt at work, probably because it added a missing tool to their theoretical tool box. The theory also produced a more favorable outlook on the personal old age of 22 percent of the staff members.",1,Nursing,1.0
"When it came to changes in the staff’s approach to care giving, 33 percent of the staff members reported on such changes. These changes were, however, of a rather passive kind. The care receivers were met with increased listening and permissiveness, but the introduction of new developmental stimuli or new topics of conversation was nearly nonexistent.",51,Transcendence,1.0
"In order to reach more substantial changes in practical care practice, a more forceful procedure is obviously needed. Such an implementation of the gerotranscendence theory was undertaken as a participant study by a registered nurse and doctoral student104 in Caring Sciences. This intervention started out with a series of focus-group sessions, where a number of practical guidelines were derived from the theory of gerotrans- cendence. These guidelines, reported on previously, were focused on what",78,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"a) the individual staff member should and should not do in the interaction with the care recipients, b) which kinds of activities should and should not be arranged, and c) how the ward should be organized in order to stimulate, or at least not counteract, the development of gerotranscen- dence. These guidelines were introduced to the staff in two experimental wards, where the observation was made that certain staff members more easily adopted the new approach, namely those who, disregarding age and professional experience, recognized in themselves aspects of the devel- opment described in the theory.",49,Adopters,0.8199009246313086
GEROTRANSCENDENCE IS NOT DISENGAGEMENT IN A NEW DISGUISE,3,Gerotranscendence,1.0
"Even if one of the points of departure for the development of the theory of gerotranscendence was the feeling that some unknown train of thought was washed away untried when we got rid of the disengagement theory,",120,Gerotranscendence,0.8325623291790296
is must be emphasized that this does not imply any theoretical kinship between the two. The theory of gerotranscendence is not the disen- gagement theory in new disguise. Gerotranscendence seem to be a positive developmental possibility with individual variations.,-1,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Already from the first qualitative study it was obvious that gerotrans- cendence cannot be regarded as any uniform development which is the same for all aging individuals. It is rather a developmental possibility, which can take different forms from individual to individual. Metaphor- ically, it may be that “the seed of gerotranscendence” is within us all, but needs proper watering to grow. This also implies that the above “signs” of gerotranscendence not were equally pronounced among the informants. It is important, however, that the individual characteristic of gerotranscen- dence still form, for the individual, coherent developmental patterns, where active involvement in new mental areas, high degrees of life satisfac- tion, and absence of psychological strain, depression, and neurotic symp- toms are parts. Quantitative studies also indicate that a high level of gerotranscendence goes with social activity and not with withdrawal and disengagement. This is particularly true when self-chosen activities are considered. Gerotranscendent individuals are shown to be more active when it comes to self-chosen activities, as compared with nongerotrans- cendendental individuals. They also show psychological involvement in new areas of mental activity.",87,Normality,0.6254369340585042
"As earlier accounted for, both satisfaction with present life and social activity correlate positively with cosmic transcendence. This illustrates that gerotranscendence in general, and cosmic transcendence in particular, are surely something other than a “disengaged mystic withdrawal,” as is sometimes incorrectly suggested (e.g., by Jo¨ nson & Magnusson, 2001). As previously shown in the 1990 Danish retrospective study of 912 Danes between the ages of 74 and 100, cosmic transcendence correlated positively with social activity.105 In the 2001 study (65+), we also found a small but statistically significant positive correlation between cosmic transcendence and social activity, at the same time as the correlation between cosmic transcendence and satisfaction with present life is also positive. This shows clearly that cosmic transcendence is not a condition related to any depressive or passive withdrawal. On the contrary, cosmic transcendence is positively related to higher social activity and more satisfaction with",24,Transcendence,0.4753936754962885
present life. From this we can conclude that gerotranscendence certainly seems to be something different from passive withdrawal as implied by the disengagement theory.,70,Gerotranscendence,1.0
WHY GEROTRANSCENDENCE GOES BEYOND OTHER DEVELOPMENTAL MODELS,8,Gerotranscendence,0.6238075868386
"Erikson’s (1950, 1982, 1986) well-known developmental model in particu- lar, as well as Baltes’s (1993) wisdom criteria, border on the concept of gerotranscendence. In both the Erikson model and the theory of gerotran- scendence, the process of aging is regarded as a developmental process which, at very best, ends with a higher state of maturity—in Erikson’s case ego-integrity, in ours gerotranscendence. In Erikson’s theory, ego- integration primarily refers to an integration of the elements of the life that has passed. The individual reaches a fundamental acceptance of the life lived, regardless of how good or bad it might seem from the outside. In this way, the ego-integrity described by Erikson becomes more of a backwards integration process within the same definition of the world as before, while the process of gerotranscendence implies more of a forward or outward direction, including a redefinition of reality. In the Baltes (1993) discussion of the criteria of wisdom, these criteria also remain within the same definition of the world as before, while gerotranscendence goes further and beyond it. Significantly enough, when Joan M. Erikson, wife and coworker of Erik H. Erikson, learned about the theory of gerotrans- cendence, she boldly added a ninth step in the Eriksonian model, in order to include the precautionary measures necessary to reach gerotranscen- dence, and then published an updated book on the Erikson model.",28,Gerotranscendence,0.8135922824534584
"The reconstructive quality of the gerotranscendence process, which distinguishes gerotranscendence from other abovementioned develop- mental models, was also suggested when we focused on the functions of reminiscence. According to our analysis,106 the unity of existence function of reminiscence, which is greatly gerotranscendence related, becomes increasingly important as we age, whereas the identity function of reminis- cence, which is related to the preservation and stabilizing the identity, decreases after the age category 25–34 years. The importance of continuity",39,Reminiscence,0.3094322794595122
"and the preservation of identity decline when growing older, while the importance of gerotranscendence-related outlook and change increases. The theory of gerotranscendence does not, however, invalidate the importance of the identity function of reminiscence. Neither does the theory of gerotranscendence deny the importance of the ego-integrity stage in the Erikson model, nor the importance of “activity” for life satisfaction. These concepts are included in and qualified in the theory, at the same time as the theory of gerotranscendence goes further. Whereas in earlier theorizing many concepts have been formulated in terms of either/or, e.g., activity versus disengagement, or continuity versus change,",28,Gerotranscendence,0.7896692343007307
