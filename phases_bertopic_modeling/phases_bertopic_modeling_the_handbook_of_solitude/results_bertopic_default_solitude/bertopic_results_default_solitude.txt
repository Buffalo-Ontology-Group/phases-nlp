Topic 0 (Solitary): confinement, prisoners, solitary, prison, isolation
Summary: Solitary confinement is a form of solitary confinement in which prisoners are isolated from the rest of the prison population. Solitary confinement is so common in prisons that it has been dubbed a “socially accepted’ practice.

Topic 1 (Creativity): creative, ideas, creativity, efforts, paulus
Summary: Creative people tend to have some characteristics in common with “lone geniuses,” such as broad interests, and inde- pendence. But the key factors in many cases is simple hard work, persistence, and a resultant high quantity of creative products.

Topic 2 (Singlehood): singlehood, single, perspective, depaulo, reasons
Summary: Singlehood is a phenomenon that is determined by multiple factors involving social, cultural, religious, and psychological ones. This chapter will present the current knowledge on singlehood from a psychologi- cal perspective.

Topic 3 (Aloneness): solitude, chapters, paradox, psychoanalytic, perspectives
Summary: The Handbook of Solitude was the first academic volume to specifically focus on the diverse theoretical and empirical approaches to the psychological study of solitude. In this second edition of the Handbook, we are absolutely thrilled to present a blend of new and updated chapters that approach solitude from a myriad of theoretical perspectives and methodo- logical approaches.

Topic 4 (Ostracism): ostracism, williams, chronic, individuals, ignored
Summary: Ostracism – being ignored and excluded – is a social phenomenon that occurs in a myriad cultures and contexts among humans and nonhuman social animals. Evolutionary theory offers an explanation for the robustness of ostracism in human society and its occur- rence within groups of othersocial animals.

Topic 5 (Solitude): presence, definition, alone, physically, solitude
Summary: Solitude can be and sometimes has been operationalized as an absence of social interaction and sometimes as physical aloneness. There is really no agreed‐upon physical “dis- tance” from others that is mandated in order for an individual to be considered alone.

Topic 6 (Primates): hinde, he, me, my, was
Summary: John van der Horst was inspired by the work of Robert Hinde and others in the field of Child Development. He says he was inspired to study social and social relationships by Hinde’s theory of social complexity.

Topic 7 (Rest): rest, athletes, sport, recovery, psychology
Summary: Athlete recovery is critical for athletes’ sport performance and health and well-being. Rest is typically associated with inactivity, which is considered to aid the athlete’s recovery from physical and psychological fatigue following training and competition.

Topic 8 (Conclusion): conclusion, remarks, conclusions, concluding, final
Summary: Conclusion Concluding Remarks Conclusions Outcomes

Topic 9 (Shyness): shyness, colonnesi, conscious, positive, smile
Summary: Shyness reflects inhibition and anxiousness in social situations, and has been conceptualized as an emotion as well as an enduring characteristic of one’s personality. Temperamental shyness has been linked to a range of internalizing problems, but primarily social anxiety.

Topic 10 (Adulthood): emerging, adulthood, decade, young, education
Summary: Emerging adulthood is a time with very little structure for young people. The median age of first marriage has continued to climb with the average age of marriage in 1996 being 25 for women and 27 for men in the U.S.

Topic 11 (Hikikomori): hikikomori, youths, countries, pathway, income
Summary: Hikikomori is generally seen as an emerging youth issue related to globalization and urbanization. It has not been the subject of research in most countries for two probable reasons: a lack of global consensus with respect to a research definition and diagnostic criteria; and more importantly, the extreme challenges, which confront research teams.

Topic 12 (Athletes): athletes, home, athlete, rest, pasta
Summary: Study: Solitude as a Means to Obtaining Mental Rest in Skilled Athlete Populations. Study: Reduced social interaction and engagement in solitude help athletes achieve the mental rest they desire.

Topic 13 (Affective): extraverts, extraverted, extraversion, reward, introverts
Summary: Extraversion and happiness are heritable, but genetic causes are not clear. Some theories of extraversion suggest physiological causes that might stem from genetic variations.

Topic 14 (Cyberbullying): digital, online, technologies, cybervictimization, young
Summary: Digital technology plays a dominant role in understanding contemporary young peoples’ peer relations. Young people’s online and offline lives complement and parallel each other, with young people utilizing online environments to fulfill developmental tasks.

Topic 15 (Shyness): adaptive, brain, shyness, neoteny, subtypes
Summary: The origins of shyness are multifaceted. We speculate that shyness may have evolved due to individual differences in frontal brain maturation, resulting from the process of neoteny.

Topic 16 (Sport): sport, athlete, hockey, just, reduced
Summary: Athletes are constantly engaged in sport-related activities during the season. This constant engagement can lead to a sense of being always thinking about their sport.

Topic 17 (Preschoolers): play, parten, onlooker, associative, categories
Summary: The study of nonsocial play at school has a long and rich history (see Coplan, 2011, for a review). Of par- ticular influence was Parten’s (1932) taxonomy of social participation.

Topic 18 (Solitude): mindfulness, mindful, zinn, kabat, awareness
Summary: Mindfulness is not an emptying of the mind, but rather an openness and sensitivity to the nuances of an individual’s emotions and physical responses. Mindfulness practice provides an opportunity for people to turn inward and nonjudgmentally witness their inner experiences.

Topic 19 (Introversion): anthony, kagan, disorders, unfamiliar, behavioral
Summary: The construct of temperamental behavioral inhibition (BI) was introduced by Kagan to refer to children exhibiting fearfulness, withdrawal, and reticence in response to unfamiliar objects, people, and situations. In contrast, introversion is a much broader trait construct that encom- passes a number of facets, including low levels of positive affect, sociability, assertiveness, activity, and excitement‐ seeking.

Topic 20 (Solitude): older, problem, everyday, adults, old
Summary: Hoppman and colleagues look into solitude experienced by individuals in older adulthood. Age-related shifts in everyday prob- lem solving may be linked with older adults’ emotional experiences during solitude.

Topic 21 (Avoidance): approach, avoidance, motivations, mehrabian, motivation
Summary: Social approach and avoidance motivations are largely independent of each other. They exhibit theoretically different (and not simply inverse) patterns of relationships with social experience and behavior.

Topic 22 (Rodents): postweaning, isolation, rats, weaning, lukkes
Summary: Social experiences that take place in childhood and adolescence play an important role for physical and mental health outcomes. In rodent work, the standard procedure used for examining the effects of social isolation in adolescence is the postweaning social isolation paradigm.

Topic 23 (Speech): piaget, flavell, assimilation, ancients, my
Summary: Robert Sears’ “Your ancients revisited: A history of child development” is a favorite of mine. I often remind younger scholars that knowledge of the past can be rather helpful in creating a viable future for any given field of study.

Topic 24 (Culture): cultural, behaviors, chen, culture, meanings
Summary: Research on culture and social withdrawal has focused mainly on the display of socially withdrawn behavior among children with different cultural backgrounds. It is difficult to establish logical and empirical links between the collective endorsement of cultural beliefs and values by a group and behaviors or developmental patterns that are displayed by individuals.

Topic 25 (Solitary): activities, solitary, adolescents, spend, alone
Summary: Solitary activities can have both costs and benefits from early childhood to adolescence. The causes and content of these solitary activities appear to be important determi- nants of the consequences of solitude.

Topic 26 (Friendships): anxiously, friendship, withdrawn, adolescents, friendships
Summary: Anxiously withdrawn adolescents who are able to form mutual and lasting friendships fare better than those who do not. Friendship dissolution is a common and challenging experience for most adolescents.

Topic 27 (Parenting): mothers, overcontrol, 1945, statements, her
Summary: The importance of the early affective relationships among caregivers and their infants has a long history of emphasis in both human and animal work. Controlling and intrusive parenting can be one factor.

Topic 28 (Autism): asd, friends, friendships, neurotypical, autism
Summary: Having friends is crucial to a child’s development of social, communication, and theory of mind skills. A lack of socially supportive relationships is linked to a plethora of negative outcomes in adolescence and adulthood.

Topic 29 (Necessity): winnicott, capacity, 1965, communicating, object
Summary: Winnicott’s views reflect a developmental and clinical conceptualization of the origins and first manifesta- tions of aloneness and solitude as well as their vicissitudes. The capacity to be alone is a major manifestation of emotional maturity and is not acquired by all individuals, whereas the necessity of being alone is universal.

Topic 30 (Introversion): adulthood, emerging, asendorpf, caspi, withdrawal
Summary: There are three different but equally important lines of research that describe the impact of withdrawal on development in emerging adulthood. Caspi et al.

Topic 31 (Aloneness): arousal, emotions, condition, neutral, deactivation
Summary: Up to half of adults’ waking time is spent alone, yet research on the experience and functions of time spent alone has been relatively neglected. In this chapter, we examine some of the varied ways people spend time alone, and the implications of time alone for emotion regulation and wellness.

Topic 32 (Dating): motivation, attributions, approach, avoidance, gable
Summary: Social approach and avoidance motivations are two fundamental motivational dimensions that differ in the perceived end state. As most social situations are ambiguous, the cognitive bias with which a person perceives the situation is important in determining whether it is interpreted in a positive or negative way.

Topic 33 (Glucocorticoids): inhibition, rats, rhesus, capitanio, behavioral
Summary: Nonhuman primates possess relatively stable temperamental and personality dimensions that are compara- ble to the dimensions studied in humans. One temperament that has been associated with experiences of social isolation in human work is behavioral inhibition.

Topic 34 (Primates): monkeys, harlow, reared, primates, deprived
Summary: Harry Harlow is one of the most prominent scientists who examined the effects of social deprivation and social isolation on nonhuman primates’ behaviors. Harlow’s studies on maternal deprivation and total isolation.

Topic 35 (Autism): asd, autism, inclusion, spectrum, supports
Summary: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by pervasive challenges in social communication. Social challenges are considered a core deficit of ASD, as many individuals on the spectrum struggle with social interactions and associated milieu.

Topic 36 (Paraprofessional): skills, paraprofessional, asd, playground, paraprofessionals
Summary: Three types of interventions have been explored that may help limit the effects of loneliness on children with ASD. These interventions include adults as paraprofessional support at school, peer‐mediated interventions, and social skills groups.

Topic 37 (Loneliness): media, problematic, use, users, kim
Summary: A large group of studies shows that heavy use of these media does not seem to do much in alleviating users’ existing problems. High levels of loneliness, depression, ADHD, or low levels of self-esteem have been found to develop problematic use of smartphones more than those with healthier psychological characteristics.

Topic 38 (Behaviorally): play, solitary, active, coplan, passive
Summary: Nonsocial play is the display of solitary activities and behaviors in the presence of other potential play partners. Solitary‐active play may be reflective of a child playing alone predominantly because other children do not want to play with them due to their immature behaviors.

Topic 39 (Anxiety): amygdala, regions, cortex, activation, clauss
Summary: The amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and orbitofrontal cortex are key components of a larger complex network that underlies anxious temperament. One possibility is that the central nucleus of the amygdala may play a role in the experience of fear and inhibition.

Topic 40 (Motivation): doing, alone, activity, autonomy, motivation
Summary: People may not always experience themselves as having choice, spending their time alone completing tasks that they think they should be doing. Autonomous motivation refers to a willingness to act, as when a person personally values an activity or finds interest in it.

Topic 41 (Loneliness): lonely, loneliness, discrepancy, peplau, assurance
Summary: Loneliness is a negative psychological experience caused by actual or perceived deficiencies in one’s relationships and from feelings of deprivation in relation to others. Being isolated or lonely means that there is a lack of support from others, which makes lonely people feel insecure and unprotected during interaction with others.

Topic 42 (Withdrawal): hikikomori, psychiatric, japan, kato, disorders
Summary: Hikikomori is a nonpsychotic phenomenon that is distinguishable from the withdrawal state based on the positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In 2010, in an attempt to offer a more acceptable definition for evaluation and, thus, garner further support for the development of services for hikkomori in Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare suggested that hikikorori could be better described as homebound withdrawn behavior from social relation- ships, employment, and other types of social participation.

Topic 43 (Deprivation): deprivation, animal, rodents, care, impact
Summary: This chapter reviews the research on the effects of social deprivation on children. We examine how, why, and when social interactions or their absence matter for healthy development.

Topic 44 (Smartphone): face, phone, smartphone, use, smartphones
Summary: Study: Loneliness is a cause or an outcome of problematic use of media. Study: Heavy use of social media hurts how people feel daily and how satisfied they are with their lives.

Topic 45 (Solitude): peer, solitude, experiences, contexts, negative
Summary: This book presents the study of solitude in different developmental stages across the life span from early childhood to older adulthood. Solitude’s relations with negative peer experiences have been studied more extensively with young children than with any other age group.

Topic 46 (Loneliness): media, face, cmc, loneliness, users
Summary: More and more people are living alone and relying on CMC as a major means for social interac- tion. We ask whether mediated communication can satiate people’s desire to be with oth- ers as much as face-to-face interaction, or even replace it.

Topic 47 (Preschoolers): bi, toddler, reticence, years, henderson
Summary: Early BI continues to shape the quality of children’s day-to-day experiences, particularly within interpersonal contexts. The Waterloo Toddler Project examined whether BI at two years predicted solitude among unfamiliar peers and inter- nalizing difficulties at age four years.

Topic 48 (Adolescence): victimization, anxiously, peer, shell, youth
Summary: Markovic and Bowker (2015) examined whether peer-valued characteristics (e.g., humor, prosocial behavior) moderated the associations between anxious‐withdrawal and two facets of young adolescents’ peer relations (i.e., peer acceptance or popularity, peer victimization) Findings suggested that peer‐valued characteristics moderated associations between anxiety and certain aspects of peer relations. The direction and strength of these associations often differed depending on the adolescents' gender.

Topic 49 (Immigrants): immigration, immigrants, immigrant, context, solitude
Summary: Solitude, that is, spending time alone or lacking social interaction, is a complex phenomenon. For most immigrants, solitude often involves unpleasant experiences of fear and discomfort with interacting with others.

Topic 50 (Awareness): condition, reflection, franzoi, brewer, consciousness
Summary: People generally report more self‐reflection and more awareness of inner thoughts and emotions when alone. This raises the question of whether deliberate thinking is considered an activity or whether it should be excluded from the definition of solitude.

Topic 51 (Aloneness): authentic, authenticity, introjects, when, inauthentic
Summary: Introjects are the “should” and “have‐to” messages people carry with them. Introjects make people feel compelled to engage in activities out of guilt or anxiety.

Topic 52 (Conclusions): directions, conclusions, future, premise, conclusion
Summary: Conclusions and Future Directions: Considering Contexts Empirical Status of Premise 1 Em

Topic 53 (Peer): peer, maltreatment, adversity, victimization, rejection
Summary: Peers’ adverse reactions to differing expressions of solitude may vary in form or severity, thereby posing different levels of risk. Peer victimization refers to harsher forms of peer maltreatment, such as when children fre- quently are the recipients of peers’ aggressive overtures.

Topic 54 (Introduction): introduction, overview, introdnction, beginnings, edition
Summary: New Edition of the New Edition of

Topic 55 (Social): sociometry, moreno, journal, manuscripts, uchida
Summary: From nonclinical perspectives, some researchers have considered prolonged social withdrawal from social constructionist (Horiguchi, 2015), social‐cultural (Borovoy, 2008, 2010), and psychological frameworks. This section of the chapter aims to review some of these non- clinical perspectives in order to broaden the reader’s appreciation of the nature of prolonged socially with- drawn behavior.

Topic 56 (Mindfulness): mindfulness, mindful, ergas, simple, butzer
Summary: Research suggests that there are positive aspects of mindful solitude that can be benefi- cial not only for adults, but for children and adolescents as well. Mindful living is quite simple, but it takes practice.

Topic 57 (Adolescence): places, favorite, green, parks, natural
Summary: There are relations among privacy regulation, restoration, and self-regulation in children and adolescents. The need to be alone, the importance of hiding places (often in nature), and the need to escape from social demands are commonly reported in these studies.

Topic 58 (Playmates): play, competence, krasnor, dramatic, you
Summary: The goal of the curriculum was to provide preschoolers with opportunities to attain concepts designed to help their entry into the public school system. The curriculum resembled that developed by Spivack and Shure that had as a goal the development of social consequential and means‐ends thinking in preschoolers and kin- dergartners attending Head Start programs.

Topic 59 (Infancy): transitional, game, playing, separation, phenomena
Summary: Freud (1920/1955a) observed that the child was able to renunciate the instinctual satisfaction caused by the mother’s presence. In this area, transitional objects and transitional phenomena appear in the beginning of life, followed by the use of symbols and playing and finally by culture.

Topic 60 (Avoidance): victimization, exclusion, peer, anxious, centered
Summary: Peer exclusion refers to peers’ attempts to marginalize children, or limit their participation in social interactions and activities. Peer exclusion also has been linked with adverse developmental outcomes (see Buhs et al., 2006)

Topic 61 (Loneliness): asd, loneliness, autism, spectrum, protective
Summary: Loneliness is widely conceptualized as an aversive, negative affective state, often likened to depression or anxiety. Individuals with autism report higher levels of loneliness in comparison to neuro- typical peers.

Topic 62 (Shyness): chen, china, shy, canada, attitudes
Summary: In Western cultures, an important socialization goal is to help children develop independence and self-confi- dence. Parents view shy, wary, and anxious behavior as indicating social imma- turity and thus often express negative attitudes toward the behavior.

Topic 63 (Inhibition): bi, psychopathology, stably, muris, switching
Summary: We review the literature on the stability of BI and its expression across develop- ment. Next, we discuss factors that may influence the development and maintenance of BI.

Topic 64 (Happiness): happiness, extraversion, facets, objection, affect
Summary: Happiness is a multifaceted construct, with affective and cognitive components. We conclude that the association between extraversion and happiness cannot be fully explained by biases in the definition or measurement of happiness.

Topic 65 (Heritability): bi, genetic, parenting, twin, parents
Summary: Twin studies comparing concordance between monozygotic and dizygotic twins have found that BI is moder- ately heritable. Although BI appears to be at least partially heritable, the specific genetic influences remain elusive (see Clauss, Avery, & Blackford, 2015 for a review)

Topic 66 (Singlehood): attachment, pepping, singlehood, attached, securely
Summary: Researchers have long been interested in examining singlehood from the perspective of attachment theory. Pepping and colleagues (Pepping & MacDonald, 2019; Pepping et al., 2018) outlined an attachment-related theoretical model of long-term singlehood.

Topic 67 (Solitude): complex, solitude, causes, consequences, well
Summary: The notion that solitude has negative consequences has a long history and can literally be traced back to biblical times (Genesis 2:18, And the LORD God said “It is not good for the man to be alone”). Contemporary approaches to the psychology of solitude now acknowledge that time alone is neither inher- ently good nor bad.

Topic 68 (Relationships): status, satisfaction, relationship, partner, single
Summary: The importance of relationships for people’s mental and physical health has been well documented in the literature. Married people report lower rates of mental illness and greater happiness in comparison to unmarried, divorced, separated, or widowed individuals.

Topic 69 (Daydreams): imaginary, companion, fantasy, fantasies, twin
Summary: A very frequent fantasy for toddlers and preschool‐aged children is the imaginary companion. This companion is an invisible person or animal created by the child who talks and plays with it for a considerable period of time.

Topic 70 (Snmmary): processes, snmmary, conclnsions, preconditions, modulate
Summary: Separateness, absence, and loss are the preconditions for symbolic connectedness. process

Topic 71 (Preschool): waterloo, hired, hire, labs, facility
Summary: In 1973, I accepted a position at the University of Waterloo. I suggested that it could become an on‐campus preschool that could provide an early education to 3‐ to 5-year-olds from middle class as well as lower income homes.

Topic 72 (Aloneness): alone, personality, autonomy, enjoyment, time
Summary: Several studies have examined personality correlates of attitudes toward spending time alone. It is important, however, to distinguish between choosing to be alone over being with others and autono- mously pursuing time alone for its enjoyment and benefits.

Topic 73 (Primate): phillips, models, nonhuman, humans, neocortex
Summary: Nonhuman primates are the evolutionarily closest animals to humans. They provide important models to understand the potential effects of deprivations in social experiences on humans.

Topic 74 (Intimacy): disclosure, patients, alden, sad, conversational
Summary: SAD patients are less likely to reciprocate the self‐disclosure of their conversational partners and, in turn, their partners are less interested in future con- tact with them. Students with social anxiety reported avoidance of expressing emotion, lack of assertion, and interpersonal dependency in their interactions with family and friends.

Topic 75 (Rodent): reared, offspring, pups, fathers, mothers
Summary: Human family structures are diverse and complex. Some children are cared by their biological parents, some by their nonbiological parents while others are reared by a combination of both biological and nonbiologically parents.

Topic 76 (Adolescents): anxious, greca, la, rapee, socially
Summary: Socially anxious children often avoid and withdraw from social interactions due to fears of being negatively evaluated and/or rejected by peers. The most notable impact of social anxiety is on the nature of peer relationships.

Topic 77 (Childhood): waterloo, wlp, withdrawal, summary, began
Summary: The Waterloo Longitudinal Project (WLP) was guided by the belief that peers influence growth and development. In our longitudinal study of typical, school attending children we demonstrated that social withdrawal: (1) is stable; (2) is associated concurrently, from early through late childhood, with measures conceptually reflective of peer rejection, observed social failures, felt insecurity, negative self‐ appraisals of social relationships.

Topic 78 (Solitude): feeling, oceanic, narcissism, vs, 1961
Summary: Solitude may be, on the one hand, a retreat in front of the pain inherent in human relations. On the other hand, it is also deemed to provide a fertile ground for the cultivation of authenticity, creativity, and genuine relationships.

Topic 79 (Motivations): northway, summer, camp, accepted, least
Summary: Mary Northway Northway (1944) conducted a series of sociometric studies of children attending both summer camps and elementary schools in the province of Ontario, Canada. The goal of these studies was to determine “the person- ality patterns of children least acceptable to their age mates”

Topic 80 (Loneliness): asd, loneliness, interventions, sequelae, treatment
Summary: Dissatisfaction with the quality of friendships or stress derived from navigating complex social milieu may contribute to the high levels of loneliness reported by children with ASD. Negative self‐perceptions and social rejection are risk factors for the development of loneliness in ASD.

Topic 81 (Withdrawn): withdrawn, deviation, kindergarten, entire, standard
Summary: Rubin, Hymel, & Mills: Social withdrawal in the first year of life predicted behavioral problems two and four years later. The consequences of social withdrawal seem to be negative regardless of the underlying motivation, they say.

Topic 82 (Withdrawn): mothers, internalizing, strategies, withdrawn, displays
Summary: Mothers were mostly similar in the emotions, causal attributions, and behavioral reactions they thought they would have in response to their children’s displays of social withdrawal in early childhood. Mothers were more likely to explain withdrawal on the basis of dispositional (e.g., temperament) or constitutional causes.

Topic 83 (Motivation): nikitin, freund, peripheral, avoidance, motivation
Summary: To date, little is known about the development of approach and avoidance motivations beyond young adulthood. Nikitin and Freund (2019b) found that older adults reported higher levels of avoidance goals in peripheral but not close relationships.

Topic 84 (Solitude): solitary, peer, subtypes, adversities, experiences
Summary: Evidence suggests that solitary children are at risk for negative peer experiences. The nature, timing, and severity of such experiences appears to vary depending on the motivations that underlie children’s manifestations of solitude.

Topic 85 (Shyness): maternal, parenting, mothers, positivity, negativity
Summary: The pursuit of solitude within interpersonal contexts – also referred to as social withdrawal – primarily is construed as arising from motivational or emotional states that exist within the child. Maternal positivity and negativity differentially influenced the development of social withdrawal in childhood.

Topic 86 (Aloneness): attachment, propose, togetherness, capacity, solitude
Summary: An Attachment Perspective on Solitude and Loneliness. Being together and being alone are two core human experiences that have both rewarding and aversive aspects.

Topic 87 (Friendships): friendships, adolescents, withdrawn, socially, school
Summary: There is convincing evidence that socially withdrawn adolescents’ peers play an important role in their lives. Despite their best efforts to avoid most peers, withdrawn adolescents still encounter groups of peers who are rejecting, victimizing, and excluding.

Topic 88 (Shyness): delta, frontal, power, maturation, beta
Summary: Study 1 examined resting state frontal EEG asymmetry among children classified as posi- tive shy, nonpositive shy, and low shy. Study 2 examined frontal EEG delta‐beta correlation among these shyness subtypes.

Topic 89 (Withdrawal): withdrawal, tendency, unfamil, voluminously, literal
Summary: Social withdrawal refers to the behavioral tendency to consistently avoid familiar and unfamil- iar peers. This behavioral tendency tends to be stable across contexts and over time.

Topic 90 (Acculturation): host, culture, immigrants, mainstream, berry
Summary: Immigration refers to people’s movement from their country of origin to another county for residential rather than visiting purposes. Immigration may be voluntary or forced.

Topic 91 (Introversion): introversion, extraversion, personality, traits, eysenck
Summary: Popular conceptions of introversion and extraversion are often attributed to Carl Jung. But empirical personality research on the topic has a history that is distinct from these.

Topic 92 (Shyness): sexual, romantic, emerging, relationships, relational
Summary: Shy emerging adults are less likely to be in a roman- tic relationship, feel less competent in romantic relationships, engage in less dating, and report lower quality relationships. Shyness has been associated with increased levels of masturbation and pornography use.

Topic 93 (Adolescence): expansion, withdrawal, peers, adolescence, dyadic
Summary: Social withdrawal during adolescence has been relatively neglected in favor of research on social withdrawal during childhood and emerging adulthood. Peers in the workplace may help with work performance and job advancement.

Topic 94 (Acculturation): acculturation, immigrant, marginalized, migrants, acculturative
Summary: Research has shown that failed attempts at participating in the host society by immigrants who are characterized by separated or marginalized acculturation styles may result in involuntary solitude. The acculturative stress model also provides a framework that connects immigrant parents’ experiences of acculturations to their children’s psychosocial experiences related to solitude.

Topic 95 (Shyness): emerging, friendships, shy, adults, closson
Summary: Shy emerging adults report experiencing less affection in their friendships, less confidence that their friendships will last, and less overall satisfaction with their friendships. Research has shown that shy young people often rely on friends to act as “social surrogates” in unfamiliar situations to help facilitate social interac- tion.

Topic 96 (Shyness): shyness, chinese, xu, regulated, adjustment
Summary: Shyness seems to be more accepted in group-oriented cultures than in Western indi- vidualistic cultures. Unlike their Western counterparts, shy children in East Asia receive parental support and experience little pressure from parents.

Topic 97 (Loneliness): romantic, adamczyk, status, single, loneliness
Summary: Adamczyk (2019) found that single adults who often and always expressed preference for an alternate relationship status also reported the lowest level of satisfaction with their single satisfaction. The transition from partner status to single status over a period of 12 months has been found to be associated with increased romantic loneliness.

Topic 98 (Loneliness): cortisol, physical, mortality, cacioppo, eisenberger
Summary: Social isolation has been associated with an elevated risk of depression, low life satisfaction, poor self-rated physical health, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in samples aged 30–103 years. For example, elevated loneliness on a given day was associated with subsequent increases in the cortisol awakening response (operationally defined by the increase in salivary cortisol during the first 30 minutes after awakening) on the following day.

Topic 99 (Shyness): unsociability, unsociable, coplan, western, children
Summary: In Western societies, shyness is generally regarded as indicating incompetence and immaturity. Research has shown that unsociability is not necessarily associated with internalizing problems or peer difficulties.

Topic 100 (Lonely): offline, resources, resource, lonelier, mediated
Summary: One of the reasons for such global escalation of loneliness might be that more people are living alone than ever. As a way to compensate for the lack of direct human contacts, today’s individuals rely on mediated communication a lot.

Topic 101 (Mobile): mobile, device, smartphones, applications, phone
Summary: Since Facebook’s debut in 2006, close to 2.77 billion people are using social media in 2019. Seventy percent of both East Asians and North Americans use social media.

Topic 102 (Summary): summary, thank, notes, your, you
Summary: “

Topic 103 (Loneliness): mother, infant, unfortunate, aloneness, cases
Summary: The infant's capacity to be alone – a capacity that develops throughout life – depends largely on the mother’s capacity to being alone. Primary maternal preoccupation, in the sense of the mother's complete devotion to her newborn baby, gradually subsides.

Topic 104 (Solitude): sad, dahl, disorder, rodebaugh, married
Summary: People with social anxiety disorder (SAD) often unable to establish satisfying relationships. SAD is associated with a variety of negative effects, including underemployment, financial hardship, and increased use of health care services.

Topic 105 (Rubin): chester, dr, dear, kurzban, chow
Summary: A number of studies have shown that the idea of a ‘golden age’ of

Topic 106 (Leisure): activities, leisure, adolescents, spent, screens
Summary: Researchers postulated that engaging in leisure activities is particularly important for staving off boredom and promoting well-being. Larson (1990, 1995, 1997) suggests that solitude is beneficial in adolescence because it affords opportunities to engage in leisure.

Topic 107 (Parenting): sad, anxiety, apa, phobia, prevalent
Summary: Social anxiety is a ubiquitous human experience. Some individuals develop social anxiety disor- der (SAD) SAD is the third most prevalent psychiatric disorder in North America.

Topic 108 (Stimulus): stimulus, barrier, stimuli, autoerotism, gediman
Summary: In Freudian theory the initial state of the human being is that of autoerotism and primary narcissism. The stimulus barrier seems to be the mechanism that ensures the preservation of this way of being.

Topic 109 (Identity): identity, exploration, commitment, career, explore
Summary: A key feature of emerging adulthood is the opportunity it affords young people to form their identity. For successful identity development to occur, there should be a period of exploration followed by commitment.

Topic 110 (Hikikomori): hikikomori, stage, stages, insecure, kasahara
Summary: Hikikomori coexists with a variety of psychiatric conditions, including adjustment disorders, anxiety‐related disorders, autism spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder, post‐traumatic disorder, Psychological perspectives. We have reviewed and summarized some of the most recent international studies on hikkomori in this chap- ter.

Topic 111 (Withdrawn): interventions, family, withdrawn, service, intervention
Summary: Some youth will withdraw due to one, two, or three of the aforementioned factors, and thus, interventions should be tailored accordingly. Innovative ideas for engagement and intervention are needed.

Topic 112 (Loneliness): problematic, media, use, outcome, cause
Summary: This chapter explores the association between problematic use of media and psychological well‐being, especially loneliness. It attempts to provide asys- tematic overview of noteworthy research findings for interested readers.

Topic 113 (Avoidance): span, approach, motivation, motivations, avoidance
Summary: In this chapter, we discuss processes that underlie the positive and negative outcomes of social approach and avoidance motivations. Taking a developmental perspective, we explore how these processes might change across the life span.

Topic 114 (Culture): emerging, roommates, adulthood, coworkers, decade
Summary: Social interactions with roommates, classmates, coworkers, and other peers may be indicators of whether or not young people are taking advantage of the opportunities afforded them in the third decade of life. There is scant research on social withdrawal in these very specific social contexts.

Topic 115 (Challenges): directions, future, go, summary, here
Summary: Future Directions Where Do We Go From

Topic 116 (Single): fear, single, spielmann, being, ex
Summary: Fear of being single was positively associated with dependence on less satisfying relationships and longitudinally predictive of the initiation (or lack thereof) of breakups. Fear of beingsingle was also a positive predictor of feelings of love and longing for ex-partners.

Topic 117 (Environment): company, urban, kaplan, restorative, environment
Summary: Social support can make a situation more restorative, and that the company of friends can serve multiple functions, conducive or not conducive to restoration. In a series of studies, we looked at the effects of different leisure environments and social context – being alone versus being with a friend – on the restorative potential of the situation.

Topic 118 (Ostracism): ostracized, ostracism, williams, needs, responses
Summary: Research has found two main types of responses to ostracism: pro‐ and antisocial behavior. Several studies suggest ostracized individuals may respond prosocially as a way to become reincluded.

Topic 119 (Rest): rest, learning, practice, consolidation, memory
Summary: Distributed practice involves practice sessions separated by rest periods ranging in duration from seconds to days. A key explanation for the beneficial effect of rest periods within distributed practice is that they allow for memory consolidation.

Topic 120 (Freud): ego, narcissism, libido, primary, infant
Summary: In Freudian theory, development is conceived as a gradual differentiation of the subject from the object. The infant is immersed in omnipotent self-sufficiency, in which satisfaction is achieved through an equally omnipo- tent other.

Topic 121 (Loneliness): loneliness, bauminger, neurotypical, asd, 2003
Summary: Early conceptualizations of loneliness delineate two distinct types, including emotional and social cognitive loneliness. Emotional loneliness is often felt in relation to the loss of an intimate companion or attachment figure.

Topic 122 (Mindful): mindful, kimmes, hansen, relationally, jones
Summary: Interpersonal mindfulness is defined as remaining aware and nonjudgmental in the presence of others. Research has exam- ined how interpersonal mindfulness may be linked to romantic relationship well-being.

Topic 123 (Safety): alden, sad, sense, identity, erickson
Summary: The ability to develop intimate relationships is dependent in part on a clear sense of one’s identity. Limited and often less positive social experiences in childhood and adolescence leave young adults with SAD less well prepared to navigate the process of identity formation.

Topic 124 (Mindfulness): yoga, mindfulness, resilience, felver, students
Summary: Research on mindfulness and yoga for children and adolescents. These studies suggest that yoga and mindfulness may have beneficial effects.

Topic 125 (Cognitions): mates, bids, hartup, acceptance, interacted
Summary: In the 1970s, it was assumed that children’s social cogni- tions were actualized by their social interactions. Researchers had shown that friendliness and sociability were positively associated with popularity among peers, regardless of the age group studied.

Topic 126 (Anxiety): bi, allele, pérez, edgar, biases
Summary: Kagan and colleagues (1988) suggested that BI resulted from an oversensitive amygdala. In the next section we summarize data on genetic, biological, cognitive, and environ- mental risk factors associated with the development and maintenance of BI.

Topic 127 (Reticence): reticent, szabo, behavior, onlooking, respond
Summary: Reticent behavior consists of onlooking (e.g., watching other children without joining in) and unoccupied behavior. This type of behavior is quite common in early childhood, observed to occur between 17–20% of the time during free play among unfamiliar peers.

Topic 128 (Insecurities): bowlby, attachment, proximity, system, 1982
Summary: John Bowlby (1982) is considered the founder of attachment theory. In his theory, human beings are born with a psychobiological system that motivates them to seek proximity to significant others in times of need.

Topic 129 (Restoration): restoration, attachments, distur, bance, nature
Summary: The evidence suggests that company of friends may enable people to experience restoration in nature without concerns for safety. Company may enhance restoration through the mutual appreciation of the given natural setting but it also may degrade restoration if attention is drawn away from the environment.

Topic 130 (Solitude): premise, adversity, peer, inference, addressing
Summary: We review the constructs of solitude and negative peer experiences, identify common or established exemplars, and summarize the conceptual distinctions that researchers have made. The strongest support for the inference that solitude, in one or more of its behavioral expressions, provokes negativepeer experiences comes from studies that examine solitude as an antecedent rather than a concurrent correlate of peer adversity.

Topic 131 (Unnamed Topic): , , , , 
Summary: 

Topic 132 (Withdrawn): withdrawn, requests, partners, cost, krasnor
Summary: Withdrawn children were found to be quiet, highly compliant, and submissive. They also experi- enced a higher than average degree of social failure.

Topic 133 (Peer): deve1opmenta1, re1ationa1, re1ation, so1itude, corresponding
Summary: The concept of Negative Peer Experiences and Corresponding Re1ationa1 Forms is

Topic 134 (Loneliness): grade, withdrawn, extremely, anxious, withdrawal
Summary: By the age of seven years (second grade), children who were identified as extremely withdrawn had more severe difficulties than their younger, preschool‐ and kindergarten‐aged counterparts. In late childhood (fourth grade) and early adolescence (fifth grade), we used the Revised Class Play to identify extremely withdrawn individuals.

Topic 135 (Shyness): regulation, rothbart, inhibitory, eisenberg, inhibition
Summary: Self‐regulation has been long regarded as a key component of temperament and personality. It has been suggested that self‐regulatory capacity may lead to individual differences in behavioral inhibition (wariness in response to novelty, a proposed antecedent of shyness) High levels of self‐regulation are known to predict positive social functioning and academic success.

Topic 136 (Oneself): asian, construal, american, european, students
Summary: Okazaki (1997) proposed that the higher social anxiety reported by Asian immigrant college students in the U.S. may be partly due to stronger interdependent self‐construal and/or weaker independent self‐ construal than European American college students.

Topic 137 (Shyness): adversities, peer, propensities, victimization, exclusion
Summary: Investigators have also studied solitude and solitary subtypes (e.g., anxious solitary/shy, unsociable, avoidant) with samples of adolescents, as well as young adults. Results showed that, whereas shyness correlated negatively with peer acceptance, both shyness and unsociability correlated positively with peer vic- timization.

Topic 138 (Maternal): seattle, booth, attachment, minnesota, matas
Summary: The author was part of a consortium being funded by the MacArthur Foundation to examine the effects of infant care on infant and toddler development. The Seattle site hosted the study of the causes and correlates of early attachment relationships.

Topic 139 (Solitary): idiom, bollas, nucleus, unthought, called
Summary: Christopher Bollas (1989) posited that each human being has a true self, which may be called idiom. The idiom meets culture and, through their dialectic, the psychic life of the individual develops.

Topic 140 (Exploration): games, exploration, smilansky, rules, hutt
Summary: Piaget (1962) in his book, Play, Dreams and Imitation in Childhood, described a taxonomic model for the devel- opment of children’s games. Sara Smilansky (1968) suggested that the child moves naturally from one “stage” of play to the next “in keep- ing with his biological development”

Topic 141 (Solitude): instruction, autonomy, received, supportive, thwarting
Summary: Nguyen et al. (under review) experimentally created three conditions: a neutral solitude condition, an autonomy‐supportive solitude condition and an autonomy-thwarting solitude condi- tion.

Topic 142 (Antonomy): solitnde, distingnishing, antonomy, anthenticity, aloneness
Summary: The Role of Antonomy in Aloneness

Topic 143 (Mindfulness): yoga, dorjee, mindfulness, zelazo, kaunhoven
Summary: As a form of positive solitude, mindfulness and yoga may provide children and adolescents with the abil- ity to momentarily disconnect from (and become more aware of ) the influence of technology on their lives. Research on adults suggests that mindfulness is associated with changes in the structure and function of a variety of brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex.

Topic 144 (Mindfulness): sexual, mindfulness, leavitt, mindful, newcombe
Summary: Practicing positive solitude during a sexual experience may be more difficult to achieve than being mindful in other day-to-day experiences. Individuals who create a mindful awareness without judgment during sexual experiences may possess an enhanced ability to observe their thoughts and feelings without immediate reaction.

Topic 145 (Athletes): practice, deliberate, performance, ericsson, expert
Summary: Deliberate practice requires considerable effort, placing great demands on the attentional systems, and where movement is required, on the physical systems. To engage in daily deliberate practice over many years, individuals must avoid becoming exhausted from engaging in such practice, given its effortful nature.

Topic 146 (Privacy): home, maxwell, private, spaces, privacy
Summary: The availability of privacy is closely related to the achievement of self‐identity and self‐ esteem. Children highly value having a room of their own that they can name as the primary place where they feel most at home.

Topic 147 (Stress): settings, stress, restorative, nature, natural
Summary: In the restorative environments literature, it is assumed that, in general, people tend to avoid settings or situations where undesired emotions may become activated. There is some evidence to suggest that spontaneous place choices to implement restora- tive coping strategies are related not only to the amount of stress, but to the sources of this stress.

Topic 148 (Introversion): pleasant, arousal, activated, extraversion, affect
Summary: There are good reasons to think that the association between happiness and introversion‐extraversion might depend on the particular operationalization of happiness. Some widely used measures may indeed favor extraverts.

Topic 149 (Loneliness): internet, support, problematic, users, media
Summary: The more people used the internet, the lonelier and more depressed they got compared to two years ago when the participants had first joined the project. A similar result was found for adolescents who used instant messengers excessively for six months and ended up having higher levels of depression than before (van den Eijnden et al., 2008)

Topic 150 (Loneliness): facebook, use, sns, passive, posting
Summary: Research on active public use and social adjustment is generally mixed. Active public use has mixed associations with loneliness, and no association with social anxiety or thwarted belongingness.

Topic 151 (Social): private, higher, content, sns, active
Summary: For young people who report greater shyness, active use may be a “safer’ route in connecting with others. Those higher in unsociability and social avoidance may find actively posting to SNSs less appealing.

Topic 152 (Introverts): objection, happiness, introverts, cultures, individualistic
Summary: Research on extraversion and happiness is conducted in Western cultures that prize individualism and assertiveness. The pattern might be different in cultures, such as Japan, that place greater value on thoughtfulness, passivity, and quiet reflection.

Topic 153 (Introversion): introverts, extraverts, quantity, wilt, 2019
Summary: A primary conceptual characteristic of introversion is frequent experience of solitude. We have already reviewed evidence suggesting that introverts spend more time alone.

Topic 154 (Athletes): sport, athletes, rest, spending, days
Summary: Being alone better enables athletes to engage in activities, and social and physical environments, that are unrelated to their sport, which helps them think less about their sport. Being alone removes cognitive costs such as those associated with the need to communicate and be socially interactive.

Topic 155 (Solitude): digital, devices, vs, computer, meaning
Summary: There is no real consensus about at what point increasingly interactive technologies would render someone as no longer “alone” One study found that emerging adults with a preference for being alone were equally happy when using devices during alone time compared to not using devices.

Topic 156 (Loneliness): media, use, problematic, connect, leisure
Summary: As with other forms of leisure, we need to consider both what the activity itself affords and what the time engaged in that form of leisure is taking away from other activities. Emerging findings suggest that unsociable and avoidant individuals may not use social media as a way to connect with others.

Topic 157 (Ostracism): unpleasantness, ostracism, unpleasant, ostracized, ren
Summary: One reason for wanting to be alone is to prevent anticipated ostracism or rejection. Ostracism certainly is an unpleasant social interaction that taxes one’s cognitive and emotional resources.

Topic 158 (Neurocognitive): somel, petanjek, brain, neurocognitive, prefrontal
Summary: There is empirical evidence for neoteny in the human brain, particularly the prefrontal

Topic 159 (Parenting): parenting, beliefs, parental, devel, 7amily
Summary: We argue that it is likely that parental beliefs influence parenting behaviors. We argue that these strategies play an important role in determining whether the child achieves social competence or develops problematic behaviors such as social withdrawal.

Topic 160 (Solitary): nonsocial, gazelle, passive, play, solitary
Summary: Solitary play was found to be negatively associated with indices of lan- guage capacity (e.g., total utterances, total words, use of unique words) Solitary‐passive play (along with reticent behavior and solitary‐active play) was also associated with teacher-rated anxious and fearful behaviors. Boys who engage in solitary play appear to be at greater risk for internalizing, social and academic difficulties as compared to girls.

Topic 161 (Socially): fail, recessive, uninterested, acceptable, difficulties
Summary: developmental scientists have regarded the peer culture as an important social- izing context for children’s development. As early as the 1930s, concerns were expressed about children who lacked the “social effectiveness” to “take their place” in social groups and become accepted by their associates.

Topic 162 (Avoidance): avoidance, 1990a, motivation, asendorpf, stein
Summary: Researchers have recently studied social avoidance (active evasion of social interactions) and its relations with adjustment. Based on limited evidence, it appears that social avoid- ance is related to peer relationship difficulties and internalizing problems in different societies.

Topic 163 (Implications): implications, interventions, directions, issues, practice
Summary: Interventions are

Topic 164 (Shyness): 05, ratings, rated, unsociability, pspi
Summary: Coplan et al. (2004) measured two forms of solitude – shyness and unsociability – along with several features of children’s social adjustment, including peer exclusion.

Topic 165 (Shyness): shyness, parental, societies, himself, encouragement
Summary: Culture may affect the functional meaning of children’s behaviors as indicated in their developmental outcomes. Shyness is generally associated with adjustment problems, including social incompetence, academic difficul- ties, negative self‐regard, and other internalizing problems in Western cultures.

Topic 166 (Solitary): stern, evoked, companions, 1985, generalized
Summary: Daniel Stern (1985/2000, 1994, 1995) was one of the main proponents of intersubjectivity – a theory highly relevant to the study of solitude. He introduced a layered model of development that was later revised to include three preverbal senses of self – emergent, core, and subjective (or intersub- jective) – all emerging together.

Topic 167 (Separateness): autistic, mahler, infant, phase, ogden
Summary: In the first two months of life, the infant lives in an autistic shell, which does not lead to disorganization. The stimulus barrier, the omnipo- tence stemming from the satisfaction of biological needs, and the hallucinatory wish‐fulfillment protect the infant from the awareness of isolation.

Topic 168 (Hallucination): mother, hallucinatory, wish, hallucination, infant
Summary: The infant seeks to repeat the remembered real experience. Relying on the memory image of the mother, the infant creates, with his/her own body and in a hallucinatory manner, a perceptually identical experience.

Topic 169 (Neuroendocrine): hofer, maternal, separations, levine, tactile
Summary: Early studies of Levine (1960) followed by Meaney’s and his colleagues work ( 1988) have made a substantial impact to the study of maternal separation and deprivation in rodents. Research has linked handling with a range of positive developmental outcomes.

Topic 170 (Nostalgic): avoidant, nostalgia, wildschut, attachment, induction
Summary: Attachment researchers have hypothesized that anxious attachment is more conducive to loneliness than is avoidant attachment. Avoidant people try to deny or inhibit attachment needs and may therefore feel less directly or less consciously frustrated by poor‐quality relationships or nonresponsive partners.

Topic 171 (Aloneness): partner, home, actor, scales, completed
Summary: Difficulty in enjoying solitude might be especially pronounced in people who score high in attachment anxi- ety. Attachment‐anxious individuals might be less accepting of their partner’s moments or periods of solitude.

Topic 172 (Infant): infant, winnicott, 1958, mother, state
Summary: According to Winnicott (1958), the capacity to enjoy moments of solitude develops from the calm experi- ence of being alone during infancy. The presence of a good enough mother, who is reliable, responsive, and sensitive to the infant’s needs, provides a temporal and spatial place for infants to exist in a state of “going‐on‐being”

Topic 173 (Study): directions, method, future, research, study
Summary: Future Research Directions

Topic 174 (Shyness): attentional, shifting, shyness, socioemotional, nonpositive
Summary: Neural correlates of attentional shifting also have been shown to moderate the association between shyness or behavioral inhibition and socioemotional adjustment. This pattern of results suggests that different aspects of self‐regulation may have different consequences for shy children across different domains of functioning (e.g., social adjustment, academic adjustment, psychopathology)

Topic 175 (Loneliness): isolation, interrelated, network, quantifiable, precision
Summary: In studies with adult populations, social isolation is often defined as an objectively quantifiable lack of social connections. Recognizing the difference between social isolation, loneliness, and solitude is key for conceptual precision.

Topic 176 (Solitude): contemplative, solitude, motives, coplan, reason
Summary: A key determining factor in how we experience solitude is whether it is sought out because of an intrinsic (i.e., autonomous, self‐ directed) motivation. An affinity for solitude is also a component of the broader person- ality dimension of introversion‐extraversion.

Topic 177 (Loneliness): cybervictimization, needs, loneliness, sullivan, zalk
Summary: Research has identified loneliness, at any age, as one of the strongest risk factors for psychological ill‐being. Cybervictimization was found to be negatively related to support from peers for adolescents in Spain.

Topic 178 (Motivations): motivation, nikitin, freund, approach, avoidance
Summary: Belongingness is a central human need. Lack of, or low quality of, social bonds impacts well‐being, health, and even mortality.

Topic 179 (Emotions): carstensen, older, english, fiori, networks
Summary: In old age, social networks are often smaller than earlier in life. One reason is social losses due to the death of members of one’s social network.

Topic 180 (Solitude): lay, pauly, affect, solitude, 85
Summary: Unlike social isolation and loneliness, solitude seems to have both negative and positive connotations. From a lifespan perspective, this raises the question of what accounts for the tremendous heterogeneity that is specific to solitude experiences.

Topic 181 (Aging): gerstorf, lifespan, timescales, old, pauly
Summary: Time alone is a ubiquitous experience across the adult lifespan that becomes even more salient in old age. Young and middle-aged adults under age 65 spend about 30–40% of their waking time alone.

Topic 182 (Anxiety): disorder, bi, disorders, anxiety, hudson
Summary: BI and anxiety disorders show considerable overlap in phenotypic presentation and course. The fact that BI is evident in infancy or early childhood suggests that BI may be a precursor or predisposition for later anxiety disorders.

Topic 183 (Shyness): adr, poole, visits, enrollment, score
Summary: We have examined the ADR score in relation to shyness during early (Schmidt & Poole, 2018) and late childhood in three separate studies. In Study 1, we examined how maternal‐reported shyness predicted the trajectory of ADR across the repeated assessments spanning age six to eight years.

Topic 184 (Shyness): right, shifting, davidson, asymmetry, frontal
Summary: Hassan et al., 2020: We found that attentional shifting, but not inhibi- tory control, moderated the association between shyness and social support seeking. We found shyness was only nega- tively associated with social.

Topic 185 (Restoration): path, restoration, encounter, visitors, forest
Summary: The presence of unknown others in natural environments has no effect on the evaluation of the environment or on restoration. In two experiments participants generally favored the empty path over the path with a person.

Topic 186 (Interpersonal): program, taxonomies, our, longitudinal, hinde
Summary: The Seattle study and the introduction of Hinde’s conceptual model of the dialectical relations between the constructs of setting conditions, individual characteristics, interpersonal interactions (or the lack thereof), dyadic and group relationships and experiences, set the stage for all that was to follow in my program of research on the topic of social withdrawal. From a personal perspective, it was the writings and research of HindE (e.g., 1987) that guided our emphasis on studying phenomena that we could see.

Topic 187 (Solitude): editors, handbook, my, stanford, hetherington
Summary: The three editors of this handbook were all fortunate to work with Kenneth Rubin as his graduate students. Rubin is widely regarded as a founder of the field of childhood social withdrawal.

Topic 188 (Solitary): session, quartet, paradigm, seattle, free
Summary: The pro- totypical “peers paradigm’ in studies of the origins, correlates, and consequences of BI and socially reticent behavior was developed in the Seattle study. At age eight years, participants were brought together in same‐sex, same‐age (+/– three months) quartets.

Topic 189 (Stability): bi, contexts, stability, nonsocial, threat
Summary: As a temperament trait, BI should be at least relatively stable. Some change is expected due to development and changing life contexts and events.

Topic 190 (Depression): grade, fifth, depression, second, assessed
Summary: We found that children who had been observed to engage in solitary behavior subsequently reported negative feelings of self‐ worth, negative evaluations of their own social competence, and a high degree of loneliness in the fourth grade. Second grade solitude also predicted feelings of low self‐worth and depression in grade 5.

Topic 191 (Loneliness): security, enjoy, representations, attachment, mikulincer
Summary: The development of an inner sense of security during interactions with a loving and responsive attachment figure is an important contributor to developing the capacity to be alone and enjoy solitude. Adults who enjoy a strong sense of attachment security tend to maintain positive representations of relationship partners.

Topic 192 (Solitary): though, bollas, idiom, wordless, imageless
Summary: Bollas (1989) defined this inevitable and authentic aloneness as follows: In our true self we are essentially alone. Only by living from this authorizing idiom do we know something of that person that we are.

Topic 193 (Withdrawal): chen, zeng, kagitcibasi, sci, modernization
Summary: The implications of social change for individual development are an important topic in developmental sci- ence. Traditional and new values may serve different functions in human development and thus may coexist through integration and organization.

Topic 194 (Personality): capacity, necessity, alone, personality, being
Summary: The Capacity to Be Alone and the Necess

Topic 195 (Bullying): bullying, asd, mediated, hebron, pmis
Summary: Children with ASD are more likely than neurotypical peers and peers with other disabilities to experience bullying. Victims of bullying are at increased risk for feelings of loneliness and other negative mental health outcomes.

Topic 196 (Interpersonal): construals, knowledge, bias, orientations, dismissal
Summary: People enter social interactions with knowledge and attitudes that they acquired during past interactions with the same relationship partner. These cognitive construals include a person’s goal structure (the goals he or she frequently seeks) and knowledge about self and others.

Topic 197 (Voluntary): aat, components, program, therapy, dog
Summary: Animal‐assisted therapy (AAT) with trained dogs and job training were developed as core components of this Regain Momentum (RM) program. Components of the program included four non‐AAT components and four AAT components.

Topic 198 (Peer): frequency, 1973, communicative, initiations, iannotti
Summary: In the 1970s, it was becoming clear that children’s social interactions with peers provided an opportunity not only to establish egalitarian and reciprocal relationships, but also allowed children to understand the rules and norms of their peer subcultures. The lack of social interaction in the peer group was associated with indices of peer acceptance and popularity.

Topic 199 (Anxious): attachment, shaver, lever, petegem, prioritize
Summary: attachment research has focused on patterns of relational expectations, emotions, and behaviors that result from internalizing a particular history of attachment experiences. Research indicates that attachment styles are conceptually located in a two-dimensional space defined by two roughly orthogonal dimensions, attachment anxiety and attachment‐related avoidance.

Topic 200 (Solitude): larson, consider, children, how, infrequency
Summary: We focus on the putative causes and conse- quences of solitary activities in childhood and adolescence. The majority of this work has focused on younger children, but some recent studies of older children and adolescents have also emerged.

Topic 201 (Psychological): vagal, tone, cardiac, restrictive, rsa
Summary: Cardiac vagal tone, because of its influences on parasympathetic functioning, is an assessment of the physiological regu- lation of arousal. Lower cardiac vagaltone, an index of emotion dysregulation and a correlate of social wariness and BI, predicted maternal engagement of harsh, restrictive parenting practices.

Topic 202 (Shyness): immigrants, temperamental, shyness, unfamiliar, host
Summary: The process of immigration and experiences of shyness in intergroup contexts. One implication of being a member of the social category of immigrants is the inevitable adaption to an unfamiliar social environment.

Topic 203 (Social): deri, schultz, allison, grotevant, intensifying
Summary: People have a tendency to compare themselves to similar others (Festinger, 1954) Adolescents tend to put great emphasis on being popular. Peer group becomes one of the strongest determinants of psychosocial functioning.

Topic 204 (Messaging): private, messaging, frison, online, initiate
Summary: In terms of dyadic‐level peer experiences, most adolescents today use social media and text messaging to correspond and interact with their friends. Interacting online with friends might be particularly appealing for socially withdrawn adolescents.

Topic 205 (Adolescent): careful, measures, socially, withdrawn, developmentally
Summary: Peers matter in the lives of socially withdrawn youth, but perhaps especially for socially withdrawn adolescents. Peer nomination measures are considered the gold standard in adolescent social withdrawal research.

Topic 206 (Motivations): withdrawal, motivational, avoidance, model, asendorpf
Summary: To date, most studies of social withdrawal have focused on social withdrawal that is motivated by social fears and anxieties. This type of withdrawal is similar to the constructs of shyness, behavioral inhibition, shyness‐sensitivity, and anxious‐solitude.

Topic 207 (Solitude): measurement, designs, analytic, researchers, strategies
Summary: In recent years, advances in theory, measurement, research design, analytic strategies, and evidence have extended knowledge about the development of solitude in children and youth. Progress in these areas have advanced researchers’ efforts to isolate and distinguish distinct facets of solitude.

Topic 208 (Ostracism): williams, resignation, temporal, stage, ostracism
Summary: Williams’s (2009) model has three stages: reflexive, reflective, and resignation. Resignation stage has received little empirical study, but preliminary evidence suggests that consistent exposure to ostracism can lead to extreme consequences.

Topic 209 (Solitude): objectives, advances, consideration, adversities, increment
Summary: In the next section we consider how the evidence assembled thus far reflects on Premise 1, or the assertion that solitude fosters negative peer experiences. Consideration is given to the strengths and limitations of the existing database, advances in knowledge, and potential directions for future research.

Topic 210 (Immigrant): foreign, immigrants, country, language, generation
Summary: Immigrants vary in their or their parents’ countries of birth and may be considered of different generations. Categorizing a person as an immigrant involves attending to cues such as discrepancies in language, accent, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, religions, skin tone or other visible markers.

Topic 211 (Immigrants): category, salience, immigrants, categories, stereotype
Summary: Despite growing numbers of immigrant populations, immigrants, especially those who are visible minorities, are usually categorized as a social group that is foreign to the host society. Research has shown that children and adults alike readily use social categories such as gender.

Topic 212 (Fomo): fomo, presentations, snss, przybylski, those
Summary: One personality trait that has received increasing attention in relation to young people’s digital technology use is the fear of missing out (FoMO) FoMO is the “pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent” FoMO has been linked to greater SNS use (Baker et al., 2016) and poorer well‐being.

Topic 213 (Solitude): questions, ultimately, daily, health, adaptive
Summary: We contend that being more explicit about matters of time would push the field in new directions. Answering these questions is crucial because it would help identify targets for intervention before negative physical and mental health outcomes manifest.

Topic 214 (Immigrants): intergroup, stephan, host, outgroup, immigrants
Summary: The stress of intergroup contact and relations experienced by immigrants may be accompanied by social anxiety. Intergroup anxiety is accompanied by a negative cognitive appraisal that interaction with outgroup mem- bers will lead to negative consequences.

Topic 215 (Avoidance): motivation, freund, avoidance, cues, nikitin
Summary: With respect to attentional and perceptual processes, social avoidance motivation is related to enhanced processing of negative information. People high in avoidance motivation avoid eye contact and talk less in social interactions.

Topic 216 (Shyness): heritage, asian, anxiety, majority, paulhus
Summary: There is growing interest in understanding the higher social anxiety symptoms reported by some immigrant groups. Results of a meta‐analysis of about 40 studies indicated that immigrants of Asian heritage on average tend to report higher levels of social anxiety than those of European heritage or members of the majority group in the host society.

Topic 217 (Avoidance): asymmetry, frontal, eeg, approach, activation
Summary: Biological tests of (social) approach and avoidance motivations are based on frontal electroencephalographic (EEG) asymmetry (Davidson et al., 1979) Frontal EEG asymmetry has been used as an index of approach and withdrawal (i.e., avoidance) motivation. According to the approach‐withdrawal model, increased activation in the left frontal cortex is associated with increases in appetitive, approach-related behavior.

Topic 218 (Turtle): inhibited, points, maternal, adolescence, childhood
Summary: The term “socially anxious” will be used to encompass all of maternal overcontrol and biological markers of emotion dysregulation in the development of socially anxious, shy/withdrawn behavior. Much of the existing research on childhood and adolescent SAD consists of a combination of clinical and non- clinical populations.

Topic 219 (Introversion): happy, happiness, extraversion, steel, introverts
Summary: There is fairly robust evidence that people scoring higher on extraversion report higher levels of happiness. Despite this, our introverted colleagues, friends, and family bristle at the idea.

Topic 220 (Solitary): solitary, behavior, subtypes, conceptions, agendas
Summary: Researchers have sought to understand why children are (or become) solitary. The diversity of motives and emotions that are hypothesized to underlie solitary propensities have enabled researchers to envision different “reasons,” or combinations of internal causes, that may account for children’s solitary behavior.

Topic 221 (Restorative): hartig, environments, demanding, restorative, restoration
Summary: In the environmental psychological literature, the term restoration refers to the process of renewing, recovering or reestablishing physical, psychological and social resources. Those environments that permit or promote restoration after being in another, more demanding environment are referred to as restorative environments.

Topic 222 (Avoidance): reticent, crying, motor, 2004, emotionality
Summary: Reticent behavior is conceptualized as a behavioral indicator of an approach‐avoidance conflict in social contexts. The frequent display of reticent behavior among peers is thought to reflect a child “trapped” in this conflict due to social fear and anxiety.

Topic 223 (Loneliness): motivation, approach, avoidance, maintenance, high
Summary: Social approach and avoidance motivations also seem to impact the maintenance of social relationships. For example, engaging in sex due to avoidance motivation (e.g., to avoid disappointing one’s partner) was found to be detrimental to relationships over time.

Topic 224 (Marriage): polish, partner, romantic, lifetime, marriage
Summary: The lack of a romantic partner appeared to be more strongly associated with increased romantic loneliness for Polish than for American participants. In societies in which people highly value the institution of marriage and attach great importance to having a partner, single individuals may face strong pressure to marry.

Topic 225 (Shyness): frontal, alpha, eeg, brain, allen
Summary: One of the most widely studied neural correlates of shyness and related phenomena is frontal brain EEG alpha asymmetry. This work is rooted in motivational models of frontal brain activation.

Topic 226 (Solitude): nguyen, spending, mined, pressured, hay
Summary: When solitude is chosen, spending time alone is viewed more positively and is associated with more positive outcomes. However, choosing to spend time alone can sometimes be viewed negatively by others and lead to rejection and ostracism.

Topic 227 (Toddlers): toddlers, fox, conduct, funding, examination
Summary: In 1990, Nathan Fox and I received initial funding from the MacArthur Foundation to conduct pilot work on the relations between frontal brain asymmetry, BI, and social compe- tence in preschoolers. One year later (1991), we received a more substantial grant from NIH to conduct a more thorough examination of these aforementioned relations.

Topic 228 (Adulthood): how, spend, time, much, spent
Summary: emerging adulthood affords young people the autonomy to choose how and with whom (if anybody) to spend their time. We know very little about how much time emerging adults spend in various activities.

Topic 229 (Solitude): aloneliness, dissatisfaction, need, psychologists, met
Summary: Social psychologists consider affiliation with others to be a basic human need. Failure to meet this need to belong can have profoundly negative implications for well-being.

Topic 230 (Anxiety): disaster, stress, bi, symptoms, anxiety
Summary: BI has been consistently linked with social anxiety. A substantial body of literature suggests that stress plays a role in the development of anxiety symptoms and disorders.

Topic 231 (Shyness): emerging, unsociable, adulthood, necessary, sary
Summary: Shyness may lengthen the time necessary to form healthy, committed rela- tionships. Future longitudinal work that extends from emerging adulthood into established adulthood will be necessary to understand the specific relational consequences of shyness during emerging adulthood.

Topic 232 (Aloneness): affinity, desire, solitropic, teppers, aloneness
Summary: The term social withdrawal is considered an “umbrella construct” capturing behavioral tenden- cies to consistently avoid and withdraw from familiar and unfamiliar peers. Affinity for aloneness expresses the desire to spend time alone and is unre- lated to the desireto spend time with others.

Topic 233 (Coping): exclusion, esteem, fact, physical, serious
Summary: There is a closely related body of literature on what has been termed “social exclu- sion’ – what happens when people are involuntarily and purposely separated from others. These studies, too, show that this kind of social separation produces a host of serious negative consequences.

Topic 234 (Loneliness): adverse, effects, isolation, importance, deprivation
Summary: The Adverse Effects of Social Isolation, Social

Topic 235 (Shyness): immigrants, accents, categorization, members, stereo
Summary: One of the most salient experiences shared among voluntary immigrants, especially those who are visible minorities, is being “othered” (Epps & Furman, 2016). That is, explicitly or implicitly, immigrants are often perceived as not belonging to the same social category as members of the majority groups in the host society.

Topic 236 (Universe): preserving, 1965, winnicott, predecessor, universe
Summary: Winnicott (1965) also stated that health means (i) being able to use noncommunication in the sense of silent or secret communication with the subjectively perceived objects and (ii) the ability to lose contact with the commonly shared reality with the aim of feeling real.

Topic 237 (Peer): spring, decreasing, increasing, grade, growth
Summary: Booth‐LaForce and Oxford (2008) used person centered growth analyses to identify multiple social withdrawal trajectories. Social withdrawal, and two forms of negative peer experience (i.e., peer acceptance/rejection, peer exclusion) were assessed via teacher reports.

Topic 238 (Aloneness): language, stern, share, shareable, intersubjectivity
Summary: In ill health, the lack of attunement by the mother cre- ates in the infant a feeling of uncanny aloneness. With the emergence of language during the end of the first year of life, the infant is more likely than before to experience the inability to share some experiences not only with others but also with the self.

Topic 239 (Aloneness): breast, thinking, bion, absent, frustration
Summary: According to Bion’s (1967) theory of thinking, thoughts are preconceptions. From the first experiences of satis- faction, which are provided to the infant by an actual breast, the preconception meets a realization and becomes a concept.

Topic 240 (Kindergarteners): kindergarteners, graders, 564, equations, rendered
Summary: Coplan et al. (2018) had parents rate three forms of solitude (i.e., shyness, unsociability, and social avoidance) several months prior to assessing children’s socioemotional functioning, including peer problems.

Topic 241 (Shyness): contact, affiliate, desire, avoid, consist
Summary: There is emerging interest in other types of children’s social solitude or withdrawal. The subtypes that have been proposed and investigated most consist- ently are: shy, unsociable, and socially avoidant.

Topic 242 (Solitude): likelihood, activities, engaging, sociability, each
Summary: In this section, we undertake an analysis of available evidence on solitude and negative peer experiences. As a heuristic tool, we consider evidence bearing on two opposing premises.

Topic 243 (Solitude): premises, precipitate, exacerbate, tends, premise
Summary: This premise con- tends that negative peer experiences precipitate or exacerbate social withdrawal and solitude. Next we
