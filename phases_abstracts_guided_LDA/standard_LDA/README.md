# Standard Latent Derelicht Allocation (LDA)

This project performs standard topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on research abstracts related to topics such as gerotranscendence and solitude and generates metrics (coherence, perplexity, topic variance) and visualizations (heatmap and pyLDAvis).


## Features

- Topic modeling using LDA 
- Coherence, perplexity, and topic variance score calculation
- PyLDAvis interactive visualizations
- Heatmap generation for topic-word distribution


    
## Configuration

The number of topics and number of words for each topic to be generated are prompted at the command line. When running the script, the user will be asked to enter the desired number of topics and words, which can be customized interactively.
