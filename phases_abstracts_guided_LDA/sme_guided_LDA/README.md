# Subject Matter Experts guided Latent Derelicht Allocation (LDA)

This project performs guided topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on research abstracts related to gerotranscendence and solitude using seed words extracted from highlighted text by subject matter experts in the abstracts. It leverages LDA with SME-driven seed words and generates metrics (coherence, perplexity, topic variance) and visualizations (heatmap and pyLDAvis).


## Features

- Common words extraction from highlighted Word document files
- Topic modeling via Guided LDA incorporating seed word priors
- Coherence, perplexity, and topic variance score calculation
- PyLDAvis interactive visualizations
- Topic-word Heatmap generation for topic-word distribution


    
## Configuration

The number of topics and number of words for each topic to be generated are prompted at the command line. When running the script, the user will be asked to enter the desired number of topics and words, which can be customized interactively.
