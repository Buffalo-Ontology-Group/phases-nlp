# Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF_IDF) guided Latent Derelicht Allocation (LDA)

This project performs guided topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on research abstracts related to gerotranscendence and solitude using top words computed by Tf-IDF. It leverages LDA with TF-IDF driven seed words and generates metrics (coherence, perplexity, topic variance) and visualizations (heatmap and pyLDAvis).


## Features

- Top words generation using TF-IDF computing
- Topic modeling via Guided LDA incorporating top words
- Coherence, perplexity, and topic variance score calculation
- PyLDAvis interactive visualizations
- Topic-word Heatmap generation for topic-word distribution


    
## Configuration

The number of topics and number of words for each topic to be generated are prompted at the command line. When running the script, the user will be asked to enter the desired number of topics and words, which can be customized interactively.
