# Topic Modeling on abstracts of research related to the PHASES project

This project is a Python application that searches for scientific articles related to specific topics such as gerotranscendence, solitude and healthy aging, retrieve their abstracts and titles, and performs topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). 

## Features

- Retrieves articles from PubMed.
- Searches PubMed for articles related to the specified keywords - gerotranscendence, solitude, healthy aging.
- The number of articles retrieved per keyword is adjustable.
- Performs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling on the retrieved abstracts.
- Identifies the main topics across the abstracts and sorts them by relevance.
- Downloads and saves the abstracts to a user-defined directory.
    
## Configuration

    The number of articles retrieved for each keyword can be adjusted by modifying the script. Currently, it retrieves a fixed number of articles, but this can be customized by altering the `retmax` parameter in the code. The number of topics generated by LDA can also be adjusted by modifying the `num_topics` parameter.
