Aging in the priesthood presents unique challenges in America. Due to the declining number of priests serving the growing U.S. Catholic population, many older priests delay retirement and continue to work while dealing with various physical, mental, and emotional challenges associated with aging. The present study examined predictors of life satisfaction in aging priests, using a combination of established predictors (age, spiritual transcendence, overall health) and three novel predictors corresponding to the three domains of gerotranscendence (cosmic, coherence, solitude) set out by Tornstam (1989, 2005). Survey data collected from 201 ordained Roman Catholic senior priests (between ages 50-93) revealed high levels of life satisfaction and satisfaction that was positively correlated with age, spiritual transcendence, and self-rated health. In addition, the combination of gerotranscendence predictors explained a statistically significant amount of the variance in life satisfaction, even when controlling for age, spiritual transcendence, and overall health. The coherence domain of gerotranscendence outperformed all other predictors in our model, suggesting that this may be an especially salient predictor of life satisfaction in aging priests. The present study lends support to the application of gerotranscendence when examining the wellbeing of older priests. Interventions aimed at fostering gerotranscendence appear crucial for enhancing priests' life satisfaction throughout their lives.

Many studies in the literature have examined older adults' past and current lifestyles in either positive or negative association with their life satisfaction levels. Health capabilities naturally decline with aging and can consequently be related to older adults' life satisfaction levels. Thus, the present study sought to examine the effects of age difference, lifestyles, and health capabilities on older adults' life satisfaction levels. A total of 290 older adults from three clinical research centers in the United States completed a self-administered questionnaire on their lifestyles and life satisfaction levels, and their health capability assessments were evaluated. There was a significant effect of advancing age on life satisfaction levels among older adults. Additionally, engagement in exercise or physical activity significantly influenced life satisfaction levels. However, there were no statistical effects of vital signs and functional assessments of health capabilities on life satisfaction among older adults. The findings suggest that advancing age itself is the strongest factor in older adults' life satisfaction. Additionally, engagement in exercise and physical activity can enhance life satisfaction levels as a supplemental factor among older adults. These findings can be beneficial to optimize life satisfaction levels through appropriate programs to encourage positive lifestyles among older adults.

Gerotranscendence is a psychosocial theory that proposes older adults experience a mindset shift in multiple dimensions (cosmic, coherence, solitude), associated with different constructs, such as life satisfaction and well-being. Increasing studies are employing gerotranscendence, but the practical aspects of how gerotranscendence can be developed are still underexplored. This review involved an assessment of the size and scope of the existing literature on interventions related to gerotranscendence and their effect on participants' well-being. Six databases were searched, and eight studies were selected: five were observational, while three were randomized control trials. Findings showed that gerotranscendence can be developed through weekly thematic encounters. Moreover, the interventions examined in the selected studies were described as having positively impacted participants' mental health and life satisfaction. Future studies should explore gerotranscendence interventions using a rigorous methodology and long-term follow-up data to add consistency to these findings.

Purpose of this study is to analyze factors affecting the healthy aging of the elderly with chronic diseases living in the community according to the worldwide aging phenomenon in line with the WHO’s healthy aging strategy. The subjects were 116 elderly aged 65 years or up with one or more chronic diseases and residing in four cities. The collected data were analyzed by using the descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson’s correlational coefficients, and stepwise multiple regression. The healthy aging of subjects showed positive correlations with the health status (r = 0.68, p < 0.001), gerotranscendence (r = 0.64, p < 0.001), self-efficacy (r = 0.65, p < 0.001), and social support (r = 0.47, p < 0.001), while the healthy aging and depression (r = −0.58, p < 0.001) showed a negative correlation. The factors affecting the healthy aging were health status (β = 0.24, p = 0.004), self-efficacy (β = 0.28, p < 0.001), education (β = −0.11, p = 0.057), exercise (β = 0.17, p = 0.003), gerotranscendence (β = 0.22, p = 0.004), and depression (β = −0.19, p = 0.009), and the explanatory power of those variables was 68.2%. Thus, it would be necessary to provide an intervention for the elderly that could habituate health-related education and exercise, maintain good health status, lower depression, aid control of themselves through the gerotranscendence, and increase self-efficacy.

The aim of this study was to learn more about the embodied experiences of people over 85 years and to gain a better understanding of how they make sense of the existential issues faced at this unique stage of life. This research is philosophically and methodologically underpinned by existential phenomenology, in particular embodiment theory, which allows exploration of everyday experiences and the personal meanings attributed to them. In-depth interviews with twenty purposively selected individuals were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Findings indicated that ways of being, relationships with others and one's place in the world continue to evolve into late life. Gerotranscendence theory best encapsulates lived experiences, with salient features including an increased need for deep reflection, positive solitude and meaningful relationships, among other features. This research provides new insights into how identity, meaning and the experience of the broader lifeworld are influenced by corporeal ageing.

Choosing to continue working after retirement eligibility can attract both negative and positive sentiments from the general public. Studies examining the motivations of older workers have so far been conducted in times of relative social and economic stability. However, little is known about what it means for older workers to work during a lockdown or pandemic situation. The present longitudinal study aimed to explore experiences of retirement-aged workers in Slovenia in relation to their motives for prolonged work activity amid the COVID-19 pandemic, using the theory of gerotranscendence as a theoretical framework. Nine workers were interviewed before and after the start of the pandemic. The qualitative analysis was based on 18 interviews and observations, juxtaposing two analytical methods in order to illustrate common themes across the data as well as tensions in specific situations within a narrative context. Four main themes are presented: Unchanged plans, Motive developments, Psychological preparation for retirement and Views of society. In addition, a narrative analysis is presented with a focus on self-transcending elements in some of the participants' narratives. The findings suggest that during a pandemic, older workers' individual experiences might be constructed more positively compared to other groups, especially if they develop agentic identity and pursue meaningful activities. We discuss an innovative approach to gerotranscendence, complementing this theory with concepts from occupational science to develop a clearer distinction from the now dated disengagement theory and examine the life trajectories of older workers in novel situations such as a pandemic.

The population of the United States is aging and by 2045 it is projected that approximately 1 in every 6 Alaskans will be 65+. Delivering healthcare and meeting the needs of older Alaskans in their community is critical to supporting healthy aging and community sustainability. Alaska Native (AN) Elders are underserved with very few studies providing an emic perspective on their experience aging. This research opens the door and allows us a glimpse of the AN Elder experience of aging: the values, beliefs, and behaviors that allow them to age well. This study highlights the characteristics and activities of AN Elders in the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands to further develop the model of AN successful aging. There are many theories of aging and this study explores a cross-cultural understanding of gerotranscendence - the personal and interpersonal changes that result from successful aging or achieving Eldership. This study interviewed Elders in two communities of the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands region. Using 22 standardized questions based on the explanatory model, researchers facilitated discussion of what it means to be an Elder and age successfully. Employing thematic analysis, interview transcripts were analyzed for themes to organize the data. Themes were organized into 5 core elements of successful aging with specific emphasis on values, beliefs, and behaviors that were protective and helped them adapt to aging-related changes. Interview content, meaning, and themes support the four elements of the AN model of successful aging developed by Lewis (The Gerontologist, 51(4), 540-549, 2011): Mental and Emotional Wellbeing, Spirituality, Purposefulness and Engagement, and Physical Health. Elders' stories highlight the importance of reflection, personal growth, and psychosocial development. Elders who more strongly identified with their role in the community described how their perspective had changed and they shared stories that emphasized culture, connection to the land, and enjoyment of daily activities that resulted in increased life satisfaction. Elders provided clear evidence that they experienced aspects of gerotranscendence, which Tornstam (Journal of Aging Studies, 11(2), 143-154, 1997) categorized as the cosmic dimension, the self, and social and personal relationships. Elders adapting to aging-related changes and embracing their role as an Elder provided the greatest evidence of gerotranscendence - they developed new perspectives on life, took on new roles within the community, and experienced a shift in mindset that reinforced the importance of culture, tradition, and the Native Way of Life. This research allowed AN Elders to share their experiences, define successful aging, and expand the concept of Eldership to include changes in mindset, values, and relationships with themselves and others. The study is a framework to help us better understand the experiences of AN Elders aging successfully and the wisdom they wish to impart to others to help them learn to live healthy and meaningful lives.

For fathers, the transition to parenthood can be experienced as an emotional phase. Fathers often state feeling overlooked and unsupported during their transition to parenthood. This study addressed this issue by exploring what it means to become a father-a qualitative design with a phenomenological hermeneutical approach. Data were collected through open-ended interviews with 19 fathers living in Sweden. The participants were encouraged to reflect on the meaning of becoming a father. Becoming a father means feeling connectedness to their child, their partner, and their friends, as well as creating strategies entailing flexibility, engagement, management, support, and solitude in their new situation. Fathers use digital media for support to create strategies, but it can evoke anxiety. The meaning of becoming a father concludes that they are deeply affected by the new situation. To support fathers during their transition to parenthood, midwives and child healthcare nurses should facilitate reflective conversations with them about their experiences of becoming a father. This study was guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research Checklist.

Loneliness and insomnia are endemic in college students, and emotion regulation is strongly related to both. Starting with a biopsychosocial framework, the present study tested a model in which emotional repair mediated the relationship between loneliness and insomnia, with the goal of using a potential mechanism of action to address loneliness. Participants were undergraduate students (N=1,513) in the United States who completed a survey including the Trait Meta-Mood Scale, Sleep Condition Indicator, and UCLA Loneliness Scale, amongst other measures. Insomnia had a significant total negative effect on loneliness, B = -0.46, 95% CI [-0.54, -0.39]. Emotional repair partially mediated this relationship, with an indirect effect of B = 0.015, 95% CI [-0.19, -0.12]. Participants with better sleep were more able to regulate their emotions, and thus tended to experience lower levels of loneliness. Treating insomnia (e.g., CBT-I) or skills associated with emotional repair and regulation (e.g., transdiagnostic approaches to emotion regulation) could reduce overall loneliness.

Busy and unstructured school environments can present challenges for pupils diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although school restaurants may be demanding, limited research has focused on these pupils. This study explores how pupils diagnosed with ASD or ADHD navigate the physical, social, and pedagogical environments of school meals. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in four Swedish schools, involving observations, conversations, and interviews with five 12-year-old boys and their mothers, findings show how pupils valued having a teacher or classmate nearby during lunchtime. Crowded and narrow spaces posed motor challenges, leading to spills and comments on table manners. Socially, pupils alternated between engaging with others and seeking solitude to escape noise and interactions. The study calls for reflection on how societal norms and environmental structures of school meals impact pupils diagnosed with ASD or ADHD, emphasizing the role of school nurses in identifying potential issues.

Abstract: 11:
Being alone is a basic and prevalent human experience, yet little is known about its effects on social identity. When alone, social identity may weaken because individuals feel their groups are less valuable or less salient. Conversely, it may strengthen because craving for bonding increases in-group perceived value. We tested these ideas with five experiments (N = 1312). Study 1, using existing groups, and Study 2, using minimal groups, showed that aloneness (vs. being with others) reduced in-group identity through its effect on in-group esteem. In Study 3, this effect was equivalent to the effect observed following social exclusion. Study 4 showed that individuals alone were indifferent in allocating money between in-group and out-group members. Last, Study 5 indicated that these effects do not stem from reduced salience of in-group members when alone. In conclusion, an alone mindset affects social identity by decreasing in-group esteem, signalling broad social implications for this basic social condition.

Introduction This essay reviews the case of Émile Nelligan, Quebec's most celebrated poet and the Institute's most famous patient. Writing a clinical case study should be relevant for readers of a scientific medical journal. This allows the transfer of important clinical knowledge for optimal medical care of patients. Yet, how do we approach a poet? What method can we adopt to avoid betraying him-neither as a poet nor as a patient? Method The approach is open. We must start by reading the poet and consult the different archives and authors who have already studied him. We trace the journey from Nelligan as a poetic prodigy to being interned in a Montreal asylum, all before he turned 20. Case Presentation An overview of the salient facts of Nelligan's family life, education, poetry, and the onset of his dementia praecox. Arguments are reviewed for Nelligan as a case study of the tension between psychiatry/antipsychiatry, freedom/constraint, madness/creativity, developmental/social determinants of health, as well as the "two solitudes" of Quebec society. Implications A reading of Nelligan torn between the dualities of the two solitudes, liberty and constraint; light and darkness; and what it means to read him as our contemporary for psychiatry, for literature and for Quebec identity.

During the early waves of COVID-19, many patients had to be isolated, with some dying alone in hospitals. Understanding the psychological impact of isolation during a potentially life-threatening disease and identifying coping mechanisms can inform future care protocols. This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of COVID-19 survivors isolated in hospitals. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 individuals who experienced hospital isolation. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using the interpretative phenomenological method. We identified three main themes: (a) the experience of isolation and proximity to death, leading to suffering, loneliness, or sometimes a positive sense of solitude; (b) coping strategies, with some being ineffective (e.g., distraction) and others effective (e.g., acceptance, family contact); and (c) isolation as a catalyst for change, resulting in either lasting sadness or personal growth and reappraisal of life priorities. Health professionals play a crucial role in helping isolated patients manage their experience, minimizing negative effects, and fostering personal growth.

Gerotranscendence, a recent adaptive aging theory developed by Tornstam, postulates a mindset shift in old age from a materialistic viewpoint to a more transcendent one. Gerotranscendence is considered a promising aging model, as it approaches specific developmental challenges in late life. However, knowledge of this theory is still maturing and lacks laypersons' perspectives to further validate its components. This study aimed to explore how older adults perceive gerotranscendence and gain insights of their understanding.

Ninety years after his death in 1934, the artistic beauty of the innovative brain images created by physician and histologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, as well as his revolutionary neuroanatomical theory, remains relevant today. As a scientist who isolated brain nerve cells, he visualized them as physically distinct entities, answering one of the most crucial questions of his time. Prior to his work, the prevailing belief was in the reticular theory, which suggested that nervous tissue was continuous and formed a network of interconnected cells. His anatomical studies helped establish the foundations of modern neuroscience. Cajal, who worked in solitude for many years, embodied one of the most important virtues of a scientist in his life: perseverance.
