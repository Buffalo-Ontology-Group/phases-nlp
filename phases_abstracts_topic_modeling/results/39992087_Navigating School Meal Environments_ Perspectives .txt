Busy and unstructured school environments can present challenges for pupils diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although school restaurants may be demanding, limited research has focused on these pupils. This study explores how pupils diagnosed with ASD or ADHD navigate the physical, social, and pedagogical environments of school meals. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in four Swedish schools, involving observations, conversations, and interviews with five 12-year-old boys and their mothers, findings show how pupils valued having a teacher or classmate nearby during lunchtime. Crowded and narrow spaces posed motor challenges, leading to spills and comments on table manners. Socially, pupils alternated between engaging with others and seeking solitude to escape noise and interactions. The study calls for reflection on how societal norms and environmental structures of school meals impact pupils diagnosed with ASD or ADHD, emphasizing the role of school nurses in identifying potential issues.
