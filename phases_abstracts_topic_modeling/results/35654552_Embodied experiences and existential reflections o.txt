The aim of this study was to learn more about the embodied experiences of people over 85Â years and to gain a better understanding of how they make sense of the existential issues faced at this unique stage of life. This research is philosophically and methodologically underpinned by existential phenomenology, in particular embodiment theory, which allows exploration of everyday experiences and the personal meanings attributed to them. In-depth interviews with twenty purposively selected individuals were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Findings indicated that ways of being, relationships with others and one's place in the world continue to evolve into late life. Gerotranscendence theory best encapsulates lived experiences, with salient features including an increased need for deep reflection, positive solitude and meaningful relationships, among other features. This research provides new insights into how identity, meaning and the experience of the broader lifeworld are influenced by corporeal ageing.
