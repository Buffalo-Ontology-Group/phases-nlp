This study assesses the impact of group therapy on young survivors of sexual abuse at a youth clinic in Sweden, focusing on self-reported outcomes and implications for primary health care. Interviews with 12 female participants aged 17-24 provided insights into the benefits of group therapy, including reduced feelings of loneliness and shame, enhanced understanding of abuse reactions and trajectories, and improved coping mechanisms. The findings support integrating group therapy into primary care settings alongside individual counseling, emphasizing the need for accessible, youth-oriented services with robust referral systems to effectively address the comprehensive psychosocial and health needs of young survivors.
