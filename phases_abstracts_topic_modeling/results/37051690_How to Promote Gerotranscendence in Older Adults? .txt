Gerotranscendence is a psychosocial theory that proposes older adults experience a mindset shift in multiple dimensions (cosmic, coherence, solitude), associated with different constructs, such as life satisfaction and well-being. Increasing studies are employing gerotranscendence, but the practical aspects of how gerotranscendence can be developed are still underexplored. This review involved an assessment of the size and scope of the existing literature on interventions related to gerotranscendence and their effect on participants' well-being. Six databases were searched, and eight studies were selected: five were observational, while three were randomized control trials. Findings showed that gerotranscendence can be developed through weekly thematic encounters. Moreover, the interventions examined in the selected studies were described as having positively impacted participants' mental health and life satisfaction. Future studies should explore gerotranscendence interventions using a rigorous methodology and long-term follow-up data to add consistency to these findings.
