Gerotranscendence, a recent adaptive aging theory developed by Tornstam, postulates a mindset shift in old age from a materialistic viewpoint to a more transcendent one. Gerotranscendence is considered a promising aging model, as it approaches specific developmental challenges in late life. However, knowledge of this theory is still maturing and lacks laypersons' perspectives to further validate its components. This study aimed to explore how older adults perceive gerotranscendence and gain insights of their understanding.
