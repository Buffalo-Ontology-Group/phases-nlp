  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Organomercurial
  Keywords:          thimerosal, autism, manufacturers, vaccine manufacturers, contain thimerosal, thimerosal containing, use thimerosal, removal, committee, use vaccines
  Summary:           In recent years, considerable controversy has surrounded the use of thimerosal, an organomercurial, in vaccines. Although there were no clear or definitive data to support a link, the U.S.

  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Adjuvants
  Keywords:          aluminum, aluminum content, licensed, adjuvant, adjuvants, aluminum salts, salts, content, aluminum vaccines, vaccines aluminum
  Summary:           Aluminum salts (aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, alum [potassium aluminum sulfate], or mixed aluminum salts) are the most commonly used adjuvants in U.S.-licensed vaccines. Concerns have been raised in recent years about the use of aluminum in vaccines.

Topic 2
  Auto Label:        Vaccine
  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Immunogens
  Keywords:          manufacturing, manufacturing process, residuals, process, vaccines licensed, licensed, additives, chapter, derived, manufacturing residuals
  Summary:           In addition to one or more immunogens,* a vaccine may contain any of several added substances such as an adjuvant or a preservative. Residual components from the manufactur- ing process, in varying amounts, are also present in the vaccine.

Topic 3
  Auto Label:        Vaccine
  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Preservatives
  Keywords:          preservative, preservatives, phenol, contamination, vials, v, contamination vaccines, following, definition, deleterious effect
  Summary:           The Code of Federal Regu- lations (CFR) requires that, with certain defined exceptions, or with the approval of the Center Director, preservatives must be added to multidose vials of vaccines. Preservatives cannot completely eliminate the risk of bacte- rial or fungal contamination of vaccines; moreover, they do not address any potential viral contamination.

Topic 4
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Influenza
  Keywords:          age, age older, older, pertussis, years age, children, quadrivalent, children years, years, glaxosmithkline
  Summary:           Of the U.S.-licensed trivalent injectable influenza vaccines, six are approved for pediatric use. The quadrivalent (Groups A, C, Y, and W135) meningococcal conjugate vaccines, Menactra (Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) and Menveo do not contain any preservative.

  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Recombinant
  Keywords:          cell, insect, produced, line, continuous, vaccines produced, cell lines, manufactured insect, insect cell, substrates
  Summary:           Several recombinant DNA- derived viral vaccines are manufactured in insect cell lines. Residual protein from these differing cell lines is present to varying degrees in the vaccines produced from them.

Topic 6
  Auto Label:        Formaldehyde
  Descriptive Label: Formaldehyde
  Keywords:          formaldehyde, residual formaldehyde, residual, requirements, allowed, infant vaccines, minimum, formaldehyde vaccines, daily, chloride
  Summary:           Benzethonium chloride with formaldehyde is cur- rently used in only one U.S.-licensed vaccine, anthrax vaccine adsorbed. Formaldehyde has a long and extensive history of use in the preparation of bacterial and viral vaccines.

Topic 7
  Auto Label:        Immunol
  Descriptive Label: Immunol
  Keywords:          gelatin, allergic, measles mumps, measles, mumps, gelatin containing, incidence, rubella vaccine, anaphylaxis measles, anaphylaxis
  Summary:           Allergic responses to gelatin, although rare, have been described in the medical literature. A severe allergic reaction to gelatin is a contraindication to receiving gelatin-containing vaccines.

Topic 8
  Auto Label:        Penicillin
  Descriptive Label: Penicillin
  Keywords:          tests, specifications, test, quantity additives, antibiotics, lysate test, lysate, cfr, tested, endotoxin
  Summary:           FDA biologics regulations address whether the use of, and quantity of, additives and residuals must be disclosed in vaccine labeling. The amount of endotoxin remaining in a final vaccine formulation depends on a number of factors, including the purification steps that are used in.

Topic 9
  Auto Label:        Pertussis
  Descriptive Label: Pertussis
  Keywords:          tetanus toxoids, toxoids, tetanus, toxoids vaccine, diphtheria tetanus, diphtheria, vaccines rational, reactions man, reduce adverse, approaches reduce
  Summary:           Diphtheria and tetanus toxoid vaccine (DT) for use in children younger than 7 years of age is available from Sanofi Pasteur Inc.

  Summary:           Vaccine.

Topic 11
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Immunogen
  Keywords:          freeze, freeze dried, dried, vaccines freeze, approximately, freeze drying, provide, drying, matrix, order
  Summary:           The amount of an immunogen that is contained in a vaccine can be extremely small, on the order of tens of micrograms or less. Various stabilizers are added to vaccines to help protect them from adverse conditions such as the freeze-drying process.

Topic 12
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Allergy
  Keywords:          milk, milk allergy, allergy, anaphylactic, cow milk, anaphylactic reactions, cow, children, pertussis vaccines, tetanus pertussis
  Summary:           Anaphylactic reactions to DTaP and Tdap vaccines may be caused by the presence of residual amounts of casein, a milk protein that is used in the culture media for these vaccines. The reactions occurred in children who already had high levels of milk allergy.
