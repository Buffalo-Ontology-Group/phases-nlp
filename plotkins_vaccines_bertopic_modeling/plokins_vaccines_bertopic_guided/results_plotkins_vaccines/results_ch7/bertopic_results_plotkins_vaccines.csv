Vaccine Additives and Manufacturing Residuals in Vaccines Licensed in the United States,2,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunogens,1.0
"In addition to one or more immunogens,* a vaccine may contain any of several added substances such as an adjuvant or a preservative. Residual components from the manufactur- ing process, in varying amounts, are also present in the vaccine. This chapter addresses the types and amounts of additives that are present in vaccines, the rationale for their inclusion, and the applicable federal regulations. Additionally, residual mate- rials from the manufacturing process that are present in the final formulation of the vaccine, as well as relevant federal regulations regarding these residuals, are discussed.",2,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunogens,0.9650131657502548
"This chapter focuses on vaccines licensed in the United States; vaccines licensed outside the United States may contain the same types of additives and residuals, although the amounts that are present in any given vaccine may differ. In addition to addi- tives, vaccines contain residuals that remain from the licensed manufacturing process. The final formulation—immunogen plus additives and residuals—defines the specific vaccine; although not all manufacturing residuals can be identified and quantified, their presence and quantity is assumed to be con- stant because of the constancy of the manufacturing process.",2,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunogens,0.8463851341749309

"Preservatives are added to vaccine formulations to prevent the growth of bacteria or fungi that may inadvertently be intro- duced into the vaccine during use. The Code of Federal Regu- lations (CFR) requires that, with certain defined exceptions, or with the approval of the Center Director (discussed later), preservatives must be added to multidose vials of vaccines. In the past, tragic consequences followed the use of multidose vials that did not contain a preservative, and served, in part, as the impetus for this requirement (see Wilson1 for a discus- sion of incidents related to the lack of preservatives in vaccines). Specifically, 21 CFR §610.15(a) states; “Products in multiple-dose containers shall contain a preservative, except that a preservative need not be added to Yellow Fever Vaccine; Polio-virus Vaccine Live Oral; viral vaccines labeled for use with the jet injector; dried vaccines when the accompanying diluent contains a preservative; or to an Allergenic Product in 50 percent or more volume in volume (v/v) glycerin.”",3,Vaccine,Vaccine – Preservatives,0.7756832013681247

"Preservatives cannot completely eliminate the risk of bacte- rial or fungal contamination of vaccines; moreover, they do not address any potential viral contamination. Although it occurs rarely, and not in the recent past, the scientific litera- ture does contain reports3,4 (see also Wilson1) of bacterial contamination of vaccines despite the presence of a preserva- tive, emphasizing the need for meticulous attention to tech- nique when withdrawing vaccines from multiuse vials. At present, the following preservatives are used in U.S.-licensed vaccines: phenol, benzethonium chloride plus formaldehyde, 2-phenoxyethanol, and thimerosal (termed thiomersal in some other countries).",3,Vaccine,Vaccine – Preservatives,1.0
"For example, it has been known for a number of years that thimerosal has a deleterious effect on the potency of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).6,7 An alterna- tive preservative is necessary for IPV. A preservative that is used in other products, 2-phenoxyethanol,8 has been found to be compatible with IPV vaccine formulations; it is used as a pre- servative in both of the currently U.S.-licensed IPV vaccines (IPOL [Sanofi Pasteur SA] and Poliovax",3,Vaccine,Vaccine – Preservatives,1.0

"In recent years, considerable controversy has surrounded the use of thimerosal, an organomercurial, in vaccines. Although there were no clear or definitive data to support a link between thimerosal and neurodevelopmental disorders, the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), first in July 199914 and again in June 2000,15 in an effort to reduce mercury exposure in children from all sources, recommended that thimerosal be removed from pediatric vaccines as expeditiously as possible. Letters from CBER of the FDA, in 199916 and again in 2000,17 to the various vaccine manufacturers noted that the removal of thimerosal from vaccines was merited and requested manufacturers’ time- lines for thimerosal removal or submission of an explanation as to why thimerosal removal was not currently feasible.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Organomercurial,1.0
"Safety Review Committee of the National Academy of Sci- ence’s IOM issued its final report, examining the hypothesis that, inter alia, thimerosal-containing vaccines are causally associated with autism. The committee concluded that the body of evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, and that the hypotheses that were generated concerning a biological mechanism for such causality were theoretical only.18 The European Medicines Agency also noted, as a precautionary measure, “that, although there is no evidence of harm caused by the level of exposure from vaccines, it would be prudent to promote the general use of vaccines without thiomersal and other mercury-containing preservatives. Of note, the WHO continues to recommend the use of vaccines containing thimerosal because the need for multidose preservative- containing vaccines and, thus, the benefit of using such vac- cines outweighs the theoretical risk of toxicity.20 Additionally, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has stated that it remains of the view that there is no evidence supporting a causal association between neurobehavioral disorders and thimerosal-containing vaccines.21 A more comprehensive update on the thimerosal-autism hypothesis for vaccines may be found in Chapter 82.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Organomercurial,0.6569123589289567

"Vaccine adjuvants are not licensed separately; rather, the adjuvant is a constituent of the licensed vaccine, and it is the vaccine formulation, in toto, that is tested in clinical trials and is licensed. An adjuvant cannot be added or removed, or its amount in a licensed vaccine changed, without submitting a supplement to the vaccine license and obtaining approval from the FDA. The various aluminum salts (aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, alum [potassium aluminum sulfate], or mixed aluminum salts) are the most commonly used adjuvants in U.S.-licensed vaccines. One vaccine, Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologi- cals), which contains AS04, an adjuvant system composed of an aluminum salt and monophosphoryl lipid A, a detoxified lipopolysaccharide (LPS), has been licensed. In 2013, as part of the U.S. government’s national pandemic preparedness ini- tiative, an H5N1 monovalent influenza vaccine, approved for use in persons 18 years of age and older, containing the unique adjuvant, AS03, manufactured by ID Biomedical Cor- poration of Quebec was licensed.

By regulation (21 CFR §610.15[a]), the aluminum content of a vaccine cannot exceed 0.85 mg of aluminum per dose if the amount is assayed, or 1.14 mg/dose if determined by calculation based on the amount of the aluminum compound that is added.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0

"Concerns have been raised in recent years about the use of aluminum in vaccines and potential adverse outcomes that may be associated with its use at the levels that exist in indi- vidual vaccines and through the additive effects of multiple vaccinations. These concerns about the use of aluminum in vaccines prompted a workshop that was sponsored by the National Vaccine Program Office in May 2000. In their overall summary of the workshop, Eickhoff and Meyers26 noted that “based on 70 years of experience, the use of salts of aluminum as adjuvants in vaccines has proven safe and effective.” A more recent study by FDA scientists, using updated parameters for toxicokinetic assessments, including current recommended vaccines and aluminum excretion data, concluded that the risk from aluminum exposure from vaccines and the environment to infants was extremely low.27",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,0.9891322168512255
"Various stabilizers are added to vaccines to help protect them from adverse conditions such as the freeze-drying process (for those vaccines that are freeze-dried) or heat. For freeze-dried (lyophilized) preparations of vaccines, it is also necessary to add materials that provide a bulk matrix for the vaccine. The amount of an immunogen that is contained in a vaccine can be extremely small, on the order of tens of micrograms or less. If sufficient amounts of various materials were not added to the vaccine before lyophilization, the vaccine would not be readily observable and would most likely adhere to the vial wall. By way of illustration of vaccine immunogen masses, ActHIB (Sanofi Pasteur SA), a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine that is marketed in a freeze-dried presentation, con- tains approximately 10 µg of purified polysaccharide conju- gated to 24 µg of tetanus toxoid. The immunogen mass for live viral vaccines is even less, on the order of nanograms (approximately 103 to 105 viral particles per dose). Thus, there is a need to provide a matrix to contain these vaccines during freeze-drying.",11,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunogen,1.0
