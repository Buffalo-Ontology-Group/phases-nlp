"Adjuvants are substances that are added to vaccine antigens to enhance and modulate the immunogenicity of the antigen. The first adjuvants developed focused on increasing antibody responses, and this has often been sufficient for the vaccines considered. During the last 2 decades, however, it has been realized that simply increasing antibody responses is not always sufficient for candidate vaccines to be effective.",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0

"In the 1940s, Jules Freund developed a water-in-oil emul- sion, the Freund adjuvant, in which the vaccine antigen is emulsified as water droplets in a continuous mineral oil phase, containing killed mycobacterium (Freund complete adjuvant) or not (Freund incomplete adjuvant). The latter was briefly used for a commercial influenza vaccine in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, but was soon withdrawn owing to unacceptable reactogenicity.",4,Influenza,Influenza – Freund,1.0

"Vaccines containing aluminum hydroxide adjuvant or aluminum phosphate adjuvant should not be allowed to freeze and should not be used if suspected of having been exposed to freezing temperatures.22 Freezing may affect the aluminum-containing adjuvant and the adsorbed antigen.

"Safety of Aluminum-Containing Vaccines. Aluminum salts as adjuvants have the longest and largest safety track record of all adjuvanted vaccines, with more than 3 billion vaccine doses used during the past 80 years with a positive risk-to- benefit ratio. The Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed MMF at a meeting in 1999. The committee found that there was no basis for recommending a change in vaccination practices involving vaccine selection, schedule, delivery practices, or information involving aluminum-containing vaccines. The committee recommended that “research studies be under- taken to evaluate the clinical, epidemiological, and basic science aspects of MMF.”35 The U.S. Food and Drug Adminis- tration, while recognizing the desirability of new adjuvants, confirmed its support of aluminum salts in vaccines.36 Research studies undertaken to assess the neurotoxicity of aluminum when it is administered intramuscularly or in a vaccine, showed a difference between the control group and the aluminum-based vaccine tested.37 A repeat of the experiment, however, did not confirm any differences between the control group and the two vaccines containing aluminum.",2,Antigens,Antigens,1.0
"Water-in-oil emulsions, of which the Freund adjuvant is the best-known example, were included in a commercial influenza vaccine in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. The vaccine was later withdrawn owing to occasional abscesses observed at the site of injection.

"These challenges suggest that for prophylactic vaccines, researchers should, when possible, avoid using water-in-oil emulsions.

"gens, MF59 was approved only in one vaccine, FLUAD, an influenza vaccine for older adults, and licensed in several European countries from 1997 onward. While there was benefit of the adjuvanted vaccine in terms of antibody response to the influenza hemagglutinin in the target population,48 the really significant benefit of MF59 and other oil-in-water emul- sions became clear during investigations on pandemic influ- enza vaccines.

"Oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants are highly effective at enhancing immunogenicity and allowing for dose reduction in pandemic influenza vaccines when the vaccinees are naïve. In contrast, the adjuvant effect for seasonal vaccines in healthy adults is quite poor.58 The benefit for priming is also evident in the studies on the use of MF59-adjuvanted seasonal vaccine in infants, who usually respond poorly to a single administration of seasonal vaccine. These studies show a strong effect of MF59 on immunogenicity59 and on efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines, with the effect being strongest in the youngest ages.60 The adjuvanted vaccine demonstrated 89% efficacy against vaccine-matched strains during two influ- enza seasons compared with 45% for the nonadjuvanted sea- sonal influenza vaccines group. On the basis of these data, Canada approved in early 2015 the use of MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (FLUAD Pediatric) for the pediatric population (6 months to 2 years of age).",5,Fluad,Fluad,0.4065787436821731

"bly one of the most important breakthroughs in adjuvant research during the last few years was the observation during the development of H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccines that oil-in-water adjuvants not only enhance the immune response and allow for dose reduction, but also enhance diversity and affinity of the antibodies induced.63 This qualitative and quan- titative expansion of the antibody repertoire has tremendous relevance for vaccination against pathogens, which undergo frequent antigenic drifts, such as influenza, as this would reduce the need for a perfect match between the antigen and the circulating pathogen strain.",7,Influenza,Influenza – Antibody,0.4564867588798747

"During the H1N1 pandemic, two influenza vaccines contain- ing an oil-in-water emulsion as adjuvant were approved and distributed in Europe (Pandemrix and Focetria); however, the uptake of these vaccines was hampered by broad media claims of the dangers of squalene. Many of these concerns seem to have arisen from a 2002 report that soldiers return- ing from the Gulf War with the so-called Gulf War syndrome had antisqualene antibodies that had been induced through receiving vaccines allegedly containing squalene.69 Although the vaccines in question did not apparently contain squa- lene, the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety reviewed all available data, including data from clini- cal trials with the squalene-containing FLUAD vaccine. Animal studies have also suggested that squalene can induce arthritis.70 However, in the animal model used, the require- ment for a specific breed and the use of a complex protocol irrelevant to the vaccination practice make it difficult to assess the relevance of these data for safety evaluation in humans.",4,Influenza,Influenza – Freund,0.4955195404367716
