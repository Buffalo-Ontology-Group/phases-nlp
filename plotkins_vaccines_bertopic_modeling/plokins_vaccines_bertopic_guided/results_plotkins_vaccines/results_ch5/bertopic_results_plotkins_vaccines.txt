  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Viruses
  Keywords:          measles, cells, cell, later, grown, vaccine, chicken, e.g., final vaccine, embryonated chicken
  Summary:           The manufacture of vaccines is composed of several basic steps that result in the finished product. Viruses are grown in cells, which can be either primary cells, such as chicken fibroblasts (e.g., yellow fever vaccine), or continuous cell lines.

  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Hepatitis
  Keywords:          aluminum, recombinant, sulfate, lot, vaccine, virus, immunodeficiency, amorphous aluminum, vaccine recombinant, qc
  Summary:           In July 1986, a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the United States. Hepatitis B vaccines are sterile suspensions for intramuscu- lar injection.

  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Influenza
  Keywords:          influenza, influenza vaccine, types, vaccine produced, trivalent, vaccine, package, trivalent types, produced, influenza virus
  Summary:           Influenza virus vaccine for intramuscular use is a sterile sus- pension prepared from influenza viruses propagated in chicken embryos. This vaccine is the primary method for pre- venting influenza and its more severe complications.

Topic 3
  Auto Label:        Vaccine
  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Vaccination
  Keywords:          prime, boost, prime boost, efficacy, boost vaccines, successful, early, clinical studies, ensure, batch
  Summary:           A new tool has emerged that uses a “prime-boost” strategy for vaccination. The concept uses one vaccine as a prime, followed by the use of an entirely different vaccine for the boost.

  Keywords:          polio, polio vaccine, eradication, polio vaccines, require, manufacturing, vaccine manufacturing, require substantial, initial, manufacturing processes
  Summary:           The manufacture of polio vaccines began in 1955. The risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis is estimated at 0.42 per million33 over a three-dose schedule.

Topic 7

  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Competencies
  Keywords:          e.g., increased, vaccine manufacturing, manufacturing, manufactured, development, manufactured worldwide, build, year given, healthy fact
  Summary:           The ability to manufacture these vaccines safely and consistently is built on four competencies. Most vaccine compa- nies focus on a core set of vaccine platform technologies.

Topic 8
  Auto Label:        Vlp
  Descriptive Label: Vlp
  Keywords:          vlps, challenge, assembly, targets, proteins, vaccine owing, assembly vlps, vlps insect, vlps challenging, neutralizing antibodies
  Summary:           For a VLP to be a realistic vaccine candidate, it needs to be These proteins are targets of neutralizing antibodies and are essential components of a vaccine. assembly of VLPs in insect cells is a different type of technical challenge to those produced viruses with multiple capsids.

Topic 9
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Regulated
  Keywords:          undergo, section, service, act, service act, health service, section public, biological, biological products, authority
  Summary:           In the United States, vaccines are regulated as biological products. Vaccines undergo a rigorous review of labora- tory, nonclinical, and clinical data.

  Auto Label:        Vaccine
  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Virus
  Keywords:          like, particles, particles vaccine, like particles, virus like, virus, based, based vaccines, traditional viral, vaccines traditional
  Summary:           Virus-Like Particle–Based Vaccines. Traditional viral vaccines rely on attenuated virus strains

Topic 11
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Ema
  Keywords:          organizations, licensure, vaccines, human, regulating procedures, vaccine working, market vaccines, effective vaccines, safe effective, delivering safe
  Summary:           The EMA’s Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use has over- sight for human vaccines. Vaccines are licensed through a centralized procedure that allows for simultaneous licensure within all countries within the European Union.
