Vaccine Manufacturing,7,Vaccine,Vaccine – Competencies,0.7550054867167592
"The vast majority of the more than 1 billion doses of vaccines manufactured worldwide each year are given to perfectly healthy people.1–4 It is this fact that drives the requirements for vaccines to be among the most rigorously designed, moni- tored, and compliant products manufactured today. The ability to manufacture these vaccines safely and consistently is built on four competencies:",7,Vaccine,Vaccine – Competencies,0.7550895033703763
"This chapter examines how each of these components is established during the development of a new vaccine and how the field of vaccine manufacturing is responding to emerging challenges for increased capacity (e.g., pandemic influenza vaccine), increased safety assurance (e.g., barrier isolator filling), and increasing complexities of manufacture (e.g., con- jugate vaccines).",7,Vaccine,Vaccine – Competencies,1.0
"In the United States, vaccines are regulated as biological products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is respon- sible for regulating vaccines. Current authority for the regula- tion of vaccines resides primarily in Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act and specific sections of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.5,6 Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act gives the federal government the authority to license biological products and the establishments where they are produced.7 Vaccines undergo a rigorous review of labora- tory, nonclinical, and clinical data to ensure safety, efficacy, purity, and potency. Vaccines approved for marketing may also be required to undergo additional studies to further evaluate the vaccine and often to address specific questions about the vaccine’s safety, effectiveness, or possible side effects.8",9,Vaccines,Vaccines – Regulated,1.0

It then moves to the regulatory requirements for vaccine manufacturing including current GMP compliance, and then discusses the development of new vaccines.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"The manufacture of vaccines is composed of several basic steps that result in the finished product. Table 5.1 summa- rizes these steps with examples for pathogens that have a licensed vaccine. Vaccines under development use additional methods that will be discussed later. Viruses are grown in cells, which can be either primary cells, such as chicken fibroblasts (e.g., yellow fever vaccine), or continuous cell lines, such as MRC-5 (e.g., hepatitis A vaccine). The final vaccine is a direct func- tion of its starting materials, and a change in this seed can be as complicated as initiating a new product development altogether.",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Viruses,1.0
"For vaccines that are composed of recombinant proteins, this step may involve many unit operations of column chromatography and ultrafiltration. For an inactivated viral vaccine, there may simply be inactivation of isolated virus with no further puri- fication. The formulation of the vaccine is designed to maxi- mize the stability of the vaccine while delivering it in a format that allows efficient distribution and preferred clinical delivery of the product. The formulated vaccine may include an adju- vant to enhance the immune response, stabilizers to prolong shelf life, and/or preservatives to allow multidose vials to be delivered.",4,Vaccines,Vaccines – Efficacy,0.757768176420795

"During this phase, individual, scrupulously cleaned, depy- rogenated, single-dose or multidose containers are filled with vaccine and sealed with sterile stoppers or plungers. If the vaccine is to be lyophilized, the vial stoppers are inserted only partially to allow moisture to escape during the lyophilization process, and the vials are moved to a lyophilization chamber. As with the formulation phase of the vaccine manufacturing operation, extensive control and monitoring of the environ- ment and critical surfaces are conducted during operations. Vaccine efficacy can be adversely affected by improper dis- tribution and storage conditions. The sensitivity of vaccines to",4,Vaccines,Vaccines – Efficacy,1.0

"Live attenu- ated vaccines tend to be more susceptible than inactivated vaccines and toxoids.1 Vaccines are formulated such that the potency at the end of shelf-life remains above the effective dose demonstrated in human clinical trials. This “overformulation” can represent a sig- nificant production yield loss and cost-of-goods increase for the final product in order to support the necessary lead times to deliver and store the vaccines, especially if they are used as a rotating stockpile to protect against supply interruption or an emergency use that does not materialize. The addition of stabilizers or lyophilization, when feasible, tends to improve the thermal resistance of vaccines.",4,Vaccines,Vaccines – Efficacy,0.9216523260293621
"cines have been detailed,9 the vaccine manufacturers are responsible for developing data before and after licensing that demonstrate the stability of their vaccines under recom- mended storage conditions for the claimed shelf life. Gener- ally, these programs provide data in excess of the claimed shelf life (up to 3 years) to support the development of new prod- ucts intended for clinical use, as well as routine support of currently marketed products, expiration date extension, and supporting distribution conditions.10,11 Accelerated studies conducted at elevated temperatures are commonly applied to better understand the impact of transient temperature excur- sions on the vaccine.",4,Vaccines,Vaccines – Efficacy,0.9216523260293621

EXAMPLES OF VACCINE PRODUCTION,0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Viruses,0.9326195534388511
Influenza virus vaccine for intramuscular use is a sterile sus- pension prepared from influenza viruses propagated in chicken embryos. This vaccine is the primary method for pre- venting influenza and its more severe complications.13,2,Vaccine,Vaccine – Influenza,1.0
"Typically, influenza vaccine contains two strains of influ- enza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and a single influenza B virus. An additional strain of the influenza B virus was added, with the first four-antigen-containing-vaccine licensed in 2012.14",2,Vaccine,Vaccine – Influenza,1.0
"The trivalent subunit vaccine is the predominant influenza vaccine used today. This vaccine is produced from viral strains that are identified early each year by the World Health Orga- nization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",2,Vaccine,Vaccine – Influenza,1.0
"These viral strains are used to prepare cells banks at each manufacturer, which cell banks are ultimately used as the inoculums for vaccine production.",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Viruses,1.0
The substrate most commonly used by producers of influ- enza vaccine is the 11-day-old embryonated chicken egg.,0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Viruses,1.0
"This is repeated for three or four strains of virus, and the individually tested and released inactivated viral con- centrates are combined and diluted to final vaccine strength.",4,Vaccines,Vaccines – Efficacy,0.5894328481473824
"The inactivated virus vaccine described above is used for the majority of flu vaccine produced and sold today. In recent years, the inactivated influenza vaccine produced on mam- malian cell culture has been approved in a number of coun- tries. A recombinant influenza vaccine, pro- duced in insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus to express the hemagglutinin protein has also been approved in the United States.",2,Vaccine,Vaccine – Influenza,1.0
"In July 1986, a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the United States. This vaccine built on the knowledge that heat-inactivated serum containing hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was not infectious, but was immunogenic and partially protective against subsequent exposure to HBV.17 HBsAg was the component that conferred protection to HBV on immunization.18 To produce this vaccine, the gene coding for HBsAg, or “S” gene, was inserted into an expression vector that was capable of directing the synthesis of large quantities of HBsAg in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",1,Vaccine,Vaccine – Hepatitis,1.0
"The purified protein is treated in phos- phate buffer with formaldehyde, sterile filtered, and then coprecipitated with alum (potassium aluminum sulfate) to form bulk vaccine adjuvanted with amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate. The vaccine contains no detectable yeast DNA but may contain not more than 1% yeast protein.7,19,21 In a second recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, the surface antigen expressed in S. cerevisiae cells is purified by several physiochemical steps and formulated as a suspension of the antigen absorbed on aluminum hydroxide.",1,Vaccine,Vaccine – Hepatitis,0.8358674324461999

"These proteins are targets of neutralizing antibodies and are essential components of a vaccine. Owing to inherent properties of the lipid envelope, assembly of VLPs in insect cells for these viral vaccines is a different type of technical challenge to those produced viruses with multiple capsids.1 For these targets, production of VLPs is a challenging task because the synthesis and assembly of one or more recombinant proteins may be required.",8,Vlp,Vlp,1.0

"By treating the HPV VLPs through a process of disassembly and reassembly, the stability and in vitro potency of the vaccine are enhanced significantly. In addition, the in vivo immunogenicity of the vaccine was also improved by as much as approximately 10-fold, as shown in mouse potency studies.27",8,Vlp,Vlp,1.0
"Vaccine development involves the process of taking a new antigen or immunogen identified in the research process and developing this substance into a final vaccine that can be evaluated through preclinical and clinical studies to determine the safety and efficacy of the resultant vaccine. Phase I and, sometimes, Phase II clinical trial vaccines are typically produced in product development, but it is usually anticipated that at least one of the three or more consistency lots used for Phase III clinical trials will be manu- factured at full-scale production volume.",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Viruses,1.0
"Early vaccines were produced in vivo (e.g., infecting calves with cowpox or rabbits with rabies virus; indeed, most influ- enza virus vaccines are still made in chicken embryos) and used neat or purified with largely glass lab equipment. Later, the animal cells used for viral vaccines were grown in vitro (e.g., roller bottles) and then infected to amplify virus for viral vaccines; later these cells were grown on microcarriers in deep culture to enable high manufacturing volumes and efficien- cies. Microbial vaccines have been produced in large (500 to 5000 L)",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Viruses,1.0
"Today, a vast majority of supply of vaccines comes from a handful of devel- oped countries because of the cost and complexity of the large-scale facilities and the profitability of those markets that support the significant manufacturing and clinical investment of public companies necessary to license and manufacture a vaccine.",5,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccina,1.0
"It is well aligned with the current developing policies of multiple emerging economies to be self-reliant for essential services like vaccine supply. For example, a 2009 agreement between GlaxoSmithKline and Brazil describes the sale of GlaxoSmithKline pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to Brazil for 8 years, with an agreement to transfer the manufacturing process to Brazil for potential use in future years.32",5,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccina,1.0
Future Challenges in Polio Vaccine Manufacturing,6,Vaccines,Vaccines – Polio,0.5721911535652113
"The manufacture of polio vaccines began in 1955, and ulti- mately resulted in two products that have been widely distrib- uted: the Salk inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and the Sabin live attenuated polio vaccine (OPV). Because the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) is estimated at 0.42 per million33 over a three-dose schedule, there is a planned transition to the Salk IPV as the polio comes closer to eradication. To ultimately make this switch, however, will require substantial increases in the capacity to manufac- ture IPV, and without productivity improvement, it would require substantial increases in the cost of delivering polio vaccines to the target populations.",6,Vaccines,Vaccines – Polio,1.0
"In addition, the dose of a live viral vaccine is typically much lower than an inactivated one, also helping the productivity of the process. This is reflected in the pricing of these vaccines. UNICEF pub- lishes the prices of vaccine procured, and in 2014 OPV in a 20-dose vial from the Serum Institute of India was $0.14/dose, whereas IPV from Bilthoven Biologicals/Serum Institute of India in a five-dose vial was $1.90/dose.34",5,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccina,1.0
"Given the potential for an accident in manufacturing that could release wild-type polio- virus into the environment, the WHO has recommended lim- iting wild-type manufacturing of IPV to geographies with high IPV coverage in the surrounding community (>90% and at least three doses), and in environments with low transmission potential.35 Currently, most of the vaccines for global vaccina- tion come from India and China, where the suppliers of vaccines have focused on low-cost production and delivery of vaccines, and these geographies are currently not an option for IPV manufacture based on the WHO GAPIII recommendations.",5,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccina,1.0
Existing polio vaccine manufacturing processes were developed years ago and use stainless steel fixed infrastruc- ture manufacturing processes. Newer single-use technolo- gies allow lower costs for initial facility design and could be used for polio vaccine manufacturing.,6,Vaccines,Vaccines – Polio,0.6365993927667215
"tive cell lines are being evaluated, which suggest much higher titers of wild-type virus that could drive down the costs of the vaccine.",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Viruses,1.0
"To allow broader manufacture of polio vaccines, an alterna- tive vaccine using the Sabin attenuated strains but then inac- tivating them is also being pursued (Sabin-IPV [sIPV]). Most importantly, the use of sIPV will allow a broader geographic set of potential locations for manufacturing, including India and China where there is substantial manufacturing infrastructure for vaccines focused on low-cost manufacturing.",5,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccina,0.9629546661873803

Prime-Boost Vaccines,3,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination,1.0
"Given the complexities of developing vaccines for difficult targets like HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and malaria, a new tool has emerged that uses a “prime-boost” strategy for vaccination. The concept uses one vaccine as a prime, followed by the use of an entirely different vaccine for the boost. Most notably, an HIV vaccine efficacy trial in Thailand had a positive result using this approach.",3,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination,1.0
"in additional HIV vaccine efficacy testing,42 TB vaccines,43 and malaria,44 among others.",3,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination,0.8419258875347856
"Several challenges arise in the use of prime-boost vac- cines that will need to be overcome if they are to be used in future licensed vaccines for distribution. The first is the com- plexity of multivalent vaccines. To have a successful batch release, prime-boost vaccines, like multivalent vaccines require successful manufacture and release of multiple com- ponents. For example, the HIV vaccines developed by the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for HIV and tested for efficacy contained six plasmid DNA components in the prime, and five recombinant ade- novirus vectors in the boost.43 This requires the production of 10 separate active pharmaceutical ingredients, which must then be combined into two separate formulations and tested.",3,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination,1.0
A critical component of assay development for any vaccine,0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Viruses,0.8565661301679605
"With two vaccines required for efficacy testing, defining exactly what the potency requirements are from each component will be important during clinical studies to ensure that future batches for distribution meet these criteria. It may require a prime- boost immunogenicity evaluation in animals for batch release, which has decreased with improved in vitro methods for potency evaluation of vaccines.",3,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination,1.0
"Most vaccine compa- nies focus on a core set of vaccine platform technologies, which allow them to build expertise in process development, assay development, and manufacturing facilities.",7,Vaccine,Vaccine – Competencies,1.0
"the vaccines cited for HIV, TB, and malaria use products from separate organizations. Ultimately, if the vaccines prove suc- cessful, there needs to be a single regulatory license holder responsible for the distribution of the vaccine, which requires careful collaboration between the different organizations for licensure and life-cycle management of the vaccines.",11,Vaccines,Vaccines – Ema,1.0
"Most of the prime-boost vaccines being tested are for early clinical trials that are designed to see an early efficacy signal from the vaccine. Even at these early stages of clinical studies, however, it is important to ensure partnerships are clearly defined among vaccine devel- opers, and the clinical studies are designed to demonstrate the true requirement for the prime-boost regime and the charac- teristics that each component must elicit after immunization. Early cost modeling can help target investments in process development to ensure that a successful signal in efficacy testing can ultimately result in a vaccine that can be successfully manufactured and distributed to the target populations.",3,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination,0.8208564968424579
"As two separate vaccines are required for complete immunizations and potentially different immunization times, deployment and supply of the vaccines have to be synchro- nized to demand. For routine immunizations this is relatively straightforward; but for any catch-up or mass vaccination cam- paigns, it requires care management of expiration dates and planning. Vaccine supply shortages are unfortunately not uncommon, and a requirement for multiple vaccines increases the possibility that one might not be continuously available, creating partially immunized and potentially off-schedule immunized individuals.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
