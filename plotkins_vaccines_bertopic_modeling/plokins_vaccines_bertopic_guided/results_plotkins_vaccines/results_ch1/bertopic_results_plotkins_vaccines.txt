  Summary:           In 1936, Frank Horsfall, Alice Chenoweth, and colleagues developed a live influenza virus vaccine in mouse lung tissue. In 1947, the influenza vaccine did not protect, definitively proving the concept of antigenic variation of the virus strain from year to year.

  Summary:           Louis Pasteur's chicken cholera vaccine harkened back to the classic variola- tion technique, which had used a weakened form of smallpox to inoculate against smallpox. The modern concept of vaccination, involving the development of vaccines in the laboratory and using the same agent that caused the disease, was truly introduced with Pasteur’s vaccine.
