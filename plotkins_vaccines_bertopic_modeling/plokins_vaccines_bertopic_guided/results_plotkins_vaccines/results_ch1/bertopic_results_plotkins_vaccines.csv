A Short History of Vaccination,20,Vaccination,Vaccination – Flower,0.5787539792698533
"Vaccination as a deliberate attempt to protect humans against disease has a short history when measured against the thou- sands of years that humans have sought to rid themselves of plagues and pestilence. Only in the 20th century did the prac- tice flower into the routine vaccination of large populations. Yet, despite its relative youth, the impact of vaccination on the health of the world’s peoples is hard to exaggerate.",20,Vaccination,Vaccination – Flower,1.0
"Since the first vaccine was introduced by Edward Jenner (Fig. 1.1) in 1798, vaccination has controlled 14 major dis- eases, at least in parts of the world: smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella, typhoid, rabies, rotavirus, and hepatitis B.",43,Vaccines,Vaccines – Vaccination,1.0

"Some 30 years later, after Jenner had popularized vaccina- tion, and thanks to the intercession of an enthusiastic vaccina- tor named Rev. Andrew Bell, Jesty was invited to London in 1805 by the Original Vaccine Pock Institute to tell the story of his 1774 “experiment” before the Institute’s examiners.",14,Vaccination,Vaccination – Vaccinated,0.6864401393574562
"Despite Jesty’s successful vaccination of his family, Jenner’s work with cowpox vaccination still holds title to the first sci- entific attempt to control an infectious disease on a large scale by means other than transmitting the disease itself.29",14,Vaccination,Vaccination – Vaccinated,0.7354589415698745
"His first manuscript to the Royal Society on vaccination was rejected because his experiment involved only one person, not enough to establish a principle.20,27 Within 2 years, he expanded his studies and proved that cowpox could be passed directly from one person to another, thereby providing “large-scale” inoculation against smallpox without depending on the spo- radic outbreaks of natural cowpox. Fortunately for the world, Jenner had the connections that Jesty did not, and vaccination rapidly replaced variolation. While Jenner did use the term “vaccine,” he is not the origina- tor of the term vaccination; that honor belongs to his friend Richard Dunning, who used it in 1800.30,31 By 1810, Jenner realized that immunity against smallpox by vaccination was not lifelong, but he did not know why.13",14,Vaccination,Vaccination – Vaccinated,1.0

"For the first several decades of the 19th century, arm-to-arm transfer was the primary method of human vaccination.37 Other recognized diseases, such as syphilis and tuberculosis, were known to be occasionally transmitted along with the “cowpox” virus, so a search was underway to find an alterna- tive way to vaccinate and to ensure a steady supply of cowpox vaccine. The concept of “passages” of the immunizing agent (transmission from one human or animal to another) was well known, and in 1836, Edward Ballard38 argued for choos- ing new strains of cowpox for vaccination because the old strains were too weak (too attenuated) from so many arm-to- arm passages.",14,Vaccination,Vaccination – Vaccinated,1.0
"According to Ballard, the idea to use animals to propagate cowpox vaccine, as opposed to human arm-to-arm propaga- tion, was first practiced in Naples, Italy, in 1805. Troja used vaccine virus derived from humans to inoculate cows and then used the lymph from the cows’ pocks to vaccinate humans. He started what was called animal vaccination, that is, inoculating from one cow to another cow to keep a steady supply of cowpox lymph. By mid- century, arm-to-arm vaccination was essen- tially replaced by animal vaccination but it is easy to under- stand why the origin of the vaccinia virus is difficult to trace.35,38 In 1864, a French physician named Lanoix studied animal vaccination in Naples and brought back to France a calf inocu- lated by Negri. He and Chambon set up a business in France for production of calf-to-calf lymph vaccine for humans.15,35,38 Subsequently, the French government became interested and ordered a study of animal vaccination.",14,Vaccination,Vaccination – Vaccinated,1.0
"Following Robert Koch’s recommendation, German scien- tists began to use glycerin to kill bacteria and to preserve the lymph.39 This generated a ready supply of a stable calf lymph of consistent potency.13 By the end of the 1890s, the use of glycerinated calves’ lymph was standard everywhere, and both arm-to-arm vaccination and unglycerinated animal vaccina- tion were abandoned.",14,Vaccination,Vaccination – Vaccinated,0.6574762243240927
Louis Pasteur and the Age of Vaccination,4,Vaccine,Vaccine – Smallpox,1.0
"Pasteur drew on con- cepts that had been developing for at least 40 years: attenua- tion; modification through passage; renewed virulence; and, most important, the need to replace person-to-person (or animal-to-animal) vaccination with something safer, consis- tent, and less likely to transmit other diseases.40",20,Vaccination,Vaccination – Flower,1.0
"From the moment he obtained the chicken cholera culture from Henry Toussaint in October 1878, Pasteur spoke of wanting to manipulate it to make a vaccine. He then challenged them with virulent organisms and they lived, so he thought he had a vaccine. So by March 1879, Pasteur realized that he had attained “resistance” to disease; he also knew he had not yet found a product that could be safely used as a vaccine.",4,Vaccine,Vaccine – Smallpox,1.0
"He focused on them for his vaccine, although he still had many problems with illness in the chickens.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"He announced that he had achieved successful vaccination against chicken cholera, but he did not reveal his technique. Finally, in October 1880, he published at least part of his method for preparation of the vaccine.20,41 Pasteur’s chicken cholera vaccine harkened back to the classic variola- tion technique, which had used a weakened form of smallpox to inoculate against smallpox. Therefore, the modern concept of vaccination, involving the development of vaccines in the laboratory and using the same agent that caused the disease, was truly introduced with Pasteur’s chicken cholera vaccine, 5 years before the famous vaccination of Joseph Meister against rabies. Ironically, the chicken cholera vaccine was never a success; there were frequent vaccine failures. Pasteur was lauded, but the vaccine was eventually discontinued.20",4,Vaccine,Vaccine – Smallpox,1.0

He first attempted to simply “filter” the blood and use it as a vaccine but quickly realized that the bacteria could pass through the filter. He used both of these techniques—and a variation on filtering in which he used 12 filters—to produce an attenuated vaccine that he injected in rabbits, sheep, and young dogs.",4,Vaccine,Vaccine – Smallpox,1.0
"On July 28, while still in Toulouse, he took fresh blood from a sheep dying of anthrax and prepared his vaccine in two lots, one with 1% phenol and the other with 1.5%. He left for Paris with his two lots of “vaccine,” where his experiment continued at Vincennes and Alfort under the watchful eyes of several researchers.

Unfortunately, that did not lessen the strenuous oppo- sition to rabies vaccination in humans nor the belief by many that the vaccination itself caused the deaths. After all, only 45 years earlier, once Jenner’s vaccination had been accepted, variolation had been made a felony in England for the very same reason: it introduced a deadly live virus into humans (as opposed to cowpox, which was not deadly).13 Grancher, the physician who administered the rabies vaccine to Meister and many others, was one of Pasteur’s staunchest supporters and was invaluable in defending Pasteur before the Académie de Médicine and against recalcitrant physicians.56 Despite the opposition, and thanks to Grancher and other supporters, Pasteur soon became a worldwide medical hero.",22,Vaccine,Vaccine – Rabies,1.0

He switched to studies of plague immunization and was himself the first to be injected with his new killed plague vaccine. However, the Mulkowal incident in 1902 when 19 people died from contaminated plague vaccine resulted in Haffkine’s removal from his post by the Indian government. Perhaps as important as his development of the plague vaccine was Haffkine’s contribution to the literature on the proper way to conduct controlled field trials.72",4,Vaccine,Vaccine – Smallpox,1.0

Opposition ran so high that consignments of vaccine were dumped overboard from transport ships in Southampton. A bitter battle about the merits of the vaccine was waged in the British Medical Journal between Wright and the statistician Karl Pearson. Ultimately, at Wright’s insistence, the War Board initiated a broad-based trial that showed the overwhelming effectiveness of the vaccine.
