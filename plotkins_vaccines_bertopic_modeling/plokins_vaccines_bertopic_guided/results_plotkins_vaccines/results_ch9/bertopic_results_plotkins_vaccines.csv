"Recommendations for immunization practices are based on scientific knowledge of vaccine characteristics, biology of immunization, epidemiology of specific diseases, and host characteristics. General guidelines for immunization practices are based on evidence and expert opinion of benefits and risks of vaccinations as they apply to the current epidemi- ology of disease and use of vaccines in the United States.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunization,1.0
VACCINE STORAGE AND HANDLING,47,Vaccines,Vaccines – Storage,1.0
"Vaccines must be properly shipped, stored, and handled to avoid loss of their biologic activities. Recommended storage and handling requirements for each vaccine are given in each manufacturer’s product information.1 Correct shipping, storage, and handling practices also are published in recom- mendations of the major vaccine policymaking committees, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the World Health Organiza- tion (see Chapter 76).2–5 Failure to adhere to these require- ments can result in loss of vaccine potency, leading to an inadequate immune response in the vaccinee. Visible evidence of altered vaccine integrity may not be present. The state/local health department or the manufacturer should be contacted when questions arise about the correct handling of a vaccine. New vaccines or new formulations of an existing vaccine may have different shipping, storage, and handling requirements. The recommended storage practices for the most commonly used vaccines in the United States are described in the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit.6",47,Vaccines,Vaccines – Storage,1.0
"usually most effective at maintaining the precise temperatures required for vaccine storage and are preferred to combination refrigerator/freezer units. This type of freezer unit is acceptable for storage of vaccines that must be stored in a frozen state (varicella, measles-mumps-rubella-varicella [MMRV], oral polio, zoster).",37,Freezer,Freezer,1.0
"Exposure to higher or lower temperatures than recom- mended can damage a vaccine. For example, live virus vac- cines, such as oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), varicella, combination MMRV, and zoster vaccine, are sensitive to tem- peratures above freezing and should be kept frozen until just before administration. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR without varicella) vaccine may be stored at either refrigerator or freezer temperature. Rotavirus vaccine and yellow fever vaccine should be stored at refrigerator temperature (2–8°C).3,7 Some vac- cines composed of purified antigens or inactivated microor- ganisms, such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae",37,Freezer,Freezer,1.0
"Maintenance of a “cold chain” from vaccine produc- tion to use helps ensure vaccine potency at the time of administration. Temperature monitoring and control are important for storage and handling of all vaccines, particularly during transport and field use. Whereas maintenance of cold and freezing temperatures may be a problem in tropical climates, data suggest that inappropriate freezing of inactivated vaccines is a problem in maintaining vaccine stability in cold and temperate climates. Shipping con- tainers should be sturdy, the correct size for the amount of vaccine to be shipped, and contain a temperature monitor. Dry ice should not be used to transport frozen vaccine, because it might expose the vaccine to tem- peratures lower than recommended for storage.",37,Freezer,Freezer,1.0
Vaccines should not be reconstituted until immediately,-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"Infection resulting from administration of vaccines is unlikely if appropriate precautions are utilized. Hands should be washed with soap and water or cleansed with an alcohol- based waterless antiseptic hand rub before each patient contact to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination and transmission of microorganisms between vaccine recipients and healthcare personnel. In general, use of protective gloves is not necessary when administering vaccines unless the healthcare provider",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunization,1.0
"Transmission of pathogens also can occur if needles, syringes, vaccines, or other equipment used to administer vaccines becomes contaminated.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunization,1.0
"Most vaccines have a similar appearance after they are drawn into a syringe. Cases in which the wrong vaccine was administered often are attributable to the practice of prefilling syringes or drawing doses of a vaccine into multiple syringes before their immediate need.5 The routine practice of prefill- ing syringes should be discouraged because of the potential for such administration errors. To prevent errors, vaccine doses should not be drawn into a syringe until immediately before administration. In certain circumstances in which a single vaccine type is used (e.g., in a community influenza vaccina- tion campaign), filling a small number (10 or fewer) of syringes before their immediate use may be considered. Care should be taken to ensure that the cold chain and sterility are maintained until the vaccine is administered. When the syringes are filled, the type of vaccine, lot number, and date of filling must be labeled accurately on each syringe, and the doses should be administered as soon as possible after filling, by the same person who filled the syringes. Likewise, vaccine drawn into syringes by the user (i.e., not by the manufacturer) should be discarded at the end of the clinic day.",49,Vaccine,Vaccine – Syringe,0.9964979015908146
"One or more routes of administration (e.g., intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intranasal, and oral) are recom- mended for each vaccine and are listed in the manufacturer’s product label and in published recommendations of immu- nization advisory committees (Table 9.1).2,5 These routes usually are determined during prelicensure vaccine studies and are based on vaccine composition and immunogenicity.",41,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunogenicity,0.8584085479635457

"Recommendations for the age and timing of vaccination are based on multiple considerations and may vary in different countries. Optimal response to a vaccine depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the vaccine and the age and immune status of the recipient. Recommendations for the age at which vaccines are administered are influenced by age- specific risks for disease and complications, ability of persons of a certain age to respond to the vaccine, and potential inter- ference with the immune response by passively transferred maternal antibody or previously administered antibody- containing blood products. Vaccines usually are recommended for members of the youngest age group at risk for experiencing the disease for whom efficacy and safety have been demon- strated.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunization,1.0
"The optimal timing for administration of measles vaccine depends on the rate of disappearance of passively acquired maternal antibody and the risk of exposure to measles virus. These antibodies inter- fere with the immune response to live virus measles vaccine by limiting vaccine virus replication. In many developing countries, where measles is highly endemic and frequently affects infants, routine measles vaccination is recommended at 9 months of age (see Chapter 21).52 However, in the United States, where measles is less common and measles among infants is infrequent, measles vaccine is recommended rou- tinely at 12 through 15 months of age, ages at which almost all infants will have no residual maternal antibody.2,53",36,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination – T36,0.6844927123627342
"Early infancy is the time of greatest risk of serious complications from pertussis, but infants who are younger than 1 month of age do not respond as well immunologically to whole-cell pertussis vaccine (and presumably acellular vac- cines) as do older infants.54–56 Initiation of routine immuniza- tion with pertussis vaccine in the United States is recommended at 2 months of age.57,58 This scheduling represents a compro- mise between factors affecting the immune response and the epidemiology of the disease necessitating early protection against pertussis. Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) given to pregnant women will stimulate the development of maternal antipertussis antibodies, which will be transferred to the fetus by the placenta, likely providing the newborn with protection against pertussis in early life.59 Tdap also will protect the mother from pertussis around the time of delivery, making her less likely to become infected and transmit pertussis to her infant.59 Vaccination too early in life also may affect the immune response to subsequent doses of vaccine. For example, neonatal administration of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DT) may result in suppression of antibody responses to subsequent doses of Hib conjugate vaccines covalently linked to forms of those toxoids.60 When children who receive measles vaccine before the age of 1 year are revaccinated, they develop vaccine- induced immunity against disease but may have a somewhat diminished antibody response compared with children vacci- nated initially after their first birthday.61,62",46,Tdap,Tdap – Pertussis,1.0

"Because of immunologic memory, intervals longer than routinely recommended between doses do not impair the immunologic response to live and inactivated vaccines that require more than one dose to achieve primary immunity. Similarly, delayed administration of recommended booster doses does not adversely affect the antibody response to such doses.2,5 As a result, interruption of a recommended primary series or an extended interval between booster doses does not necessitate reinitiation of the entire vaccination series. For example, lengthening the interval between two doses of inac- tivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) may increase the antibody response to the second dose.66 In the case of oral typhoid (Ty21a) vaccine, an exception has been proposed.

"The possibility that two doses of the same or different live virus vaccines administered within too short an interval may inhibit the immunologic response to the second dose is based on evidence from animal and human studies. Petralli and colleagues68,69 reported that the immune response to smallpox vaccination was affected by prior administration of live attenu- ated measles vaccine. Interferon produced in response to the initial dose of measles virus vaccine has been postulated to inhibit replication of vaccinia virus in the subsequent vaccine dose. In a study in two U.S. health maintenance organizations, persons who received varicella vaccine less than 30 days after MMR vaccination had an increased risk of varicella vaccine failure (i.e., varicella disease in a vaccinated person) of 2.5- fold compared with persons who received varicella vaccine before or 30 days or more after MMR.70 In contrast, Stefano and colleagues71 determined that the response to yellow fever vaccine is not affected by monovalent measles vaccine admin- istered 1 to 27 days earlier. In general, live virus vaccines administered orally do not interfere with live virus vaccines administered parenterally or orally, although a reduction in the seroconversion rate following the first dose of monovalent rotavirus vaccine has been reported when this dose is admin- istered concurrently with OPV.72 The effect of nasally admin- istered vaccine on the response to other live vaccines not administered at the same visit is not known.",14,Vaccines,Vaccines – Interferon,0.7632187628004162

"Increased severity or incidence of adverse reactions has not been observed after simultaneous administration of the most widely used vaccines.5 Similarly, simultaneous administration of vaccines generally does not cause immunologic interfer- ence, with two exceptions. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and Menactra brand meningococcal conjugate vaccine should not be administered simultaneously in children with func- tional or anatomic asplenia, because Menactra interferes with the immune response to the seven-valent pneumococcal con- jugate vaccine (and presumably PCV13 as well). All doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should be administered first and then a dose of Menactra should be administered 4 weeks after the last dose of pneu- mococcal conjugate vaccine. Interference is not known to occur with other brands of meningococcal conjugate vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Pneumococcal polysac- charide vaccine may interfere with the immune response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.

"To elicit an adequate immune response, live vaccine virus must replicate in the recipient. The probable mechanism by which passively acquired immunoglobulin blunts the immune response is neutralization of vaccine virus, resulting in inhibi- tion of viral replication and insufficient antigenic mass.79 For example, persisting transplacentally acquired maternal measles antibodies inhibit the response to live measles vaccine in infants for as long as 12 months and perhaps longer.80,81 The age to which inhibition persists has been correlated with con- centrations of maternal or cord blood antibodies.82–84 Rubella vaccine virus may be less susceptible than measles vaccine virus to these transplacentally acquired maternal antibod- ies.83,85 The effect of blood and immunoglobulin preparations on the response to mumps and varicella vaccines is unknown, but commercial immunoglobulin preparations contain anti- bodies to these viruses.

"immunoglobulin–containing preparations (e.g., immuno- globulin, hyperimmunoglobulins, intravenous immunoglob- ulin, and blood) before or simultaneously with certain vaccines also can affect the immune response to live virus vac- cines. When partially attenuated Edmonston B measles vaccine, which is no longer available in the United States, was administered concurrently with measles immunoglobulin in an effort to reduce the incidence of adverse events associated with this vaccine, the rate of seroconversion was not affected but the geometric mean titer of serum measles antibody was diminished.86 In a study of an investigational bacterial poly- saccharide immunoglobulin (BPIG), children had a reduced immune response to live measles vaccine for as long as 5 months after receipt of BPIG.87 The measles antibody serocon- version rate and geometric mean titer were lower among chil- dren who received BPIG compared with children who received placebo.

Moderate doses of parenterally administered immu- noglobulins have not inhibited development of a protective immune response to DTP, tetanus toxoid, and Hib conjugate vaccines.94,95 Although the concurrent administration of inac- tivated hepatitis A vaccine and immunoglobulin can result in lower serum antibody concentrations than if vaccine alone is administered, seroconversion rates have not been dimin- ished.96,97 Infants with high concentrations of passively acquired maternal antibody to hepatitis A virus had lower serum antibody concentrations after receipt of hepatitis A vaccine but had seroconversion rates similar to those of vaccinated infants without maternal antibodies.98 Similarly, seroconversion rates to inactivated polio vaccine given on a 2-, 4-, and 6-month schedule were lower among infants who had high maternal antibody levels for all three poliovirus types.99",3,Poliovirus,Poliovirus,0.3262627310663936

"Because neurologic disorders such as epilepsy and degen- erative disorders marked by loss of developmental milestones often become manifest during infancy, pertussis vaccination may coincide with onset or recognition of such disorders and cause confusion about the etiologic role of the vaccine. For infants with a personal history of a seizure, delaying pertussis vaccination is recommended until a progressive neurologic disorder is excluded or the cause of the seizure has been estab- lished.57,58 Because measles vaccine is administered at an age when a child’s neurologic status is likely to already have been established, deferring measles immunization of a child with a personal history of a seizure is not recommended.53,184",38,Vaccines,Vaccines – Seizures,1.0
"Pertussis and measles vaccinations are not contraindicated in persons with a family history of seizures. Even though children with a parent or sibling who has had a seizure are themselves at increased risk for a seizure, the benefits of administering pertussis and measles vaccine to children with a family history of seizures substantially outweigh the small risks because the seizures are usually febrile in origin, gener- ally have a benign outcome, and are not likely to be confused with manifestations of a previously unrecognized neurologic disorder.53,58,184,222,224 In June 2009, after consideration of the postlicensure data and other evidence, ACIP adopted recom- mendations regarding use of MMRV vaccine for the first and second doses and identified a personal or family (i.e., sibling or parent) history of seizure as a precaution for use of MMRV vaccine. For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at age 12 to 47 months, either MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine or MMRV vaccine may be used. Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination options with the parents or caregivers. Unless the parent or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC recommends that MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine should be adminis- tered for the first dose in this age group. For the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at any age (15 months to 12 years) and for the first dose at age 48 months or older, use of MMRV vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine).
