  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Polio
  Keywords:          rotavirus, rotavirus vaccine, live oral, infant, oral, rotavirus vaccines, oral rotavirus, administered time, infants, breastfeeding
  Summary:           For vaccines given orally, the vaccine must be swallowed and retained. A dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) should be repeated immediately if a patient spits out, does not swallow, or regurgitates a dose within 10 minutes after administra- tion.

  Auto Label:        Vaccine
  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Egg
  Keywords:          yellow fever, fever, yellow, egg, fever vaccine, egg ingestion, strain, skin tests, egg protein, ingestion
  Summary:           Egg protein is a constituent of vaccines prepared with use of embryonated chicken eggs, such as influenza and yellow fever vaccines. On rare occasions, these vaccines can induce anaphylaxis or other immediate hypersensitivity reactions, and these reactions are sometimes attributed to egg protein antigen.

  Auto Label:        Anaphylactic
  Descriptive Label: Anaphylactic
  Keywords:          anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, vaccine components, hypersensitivity reactions, providing, reaction, anaphylactic, administration vaccine, rare, anaphylactic reaction
  Summary:           Hypersensitivity reactions after vaccination can be local or systemic and can vary in severity from mild discomfort at the site of vaccination to severe anaphylaxis. Whether a specific hypersensitivity reaction is caused by a vaccine com- ponent or an unrelated environmental allergen can be difficult to determine.

Topic 14
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Interferon
  Keywords:          live, response live, virus vaccines, inhibit, live virus, virus, persons received, nasally, long, admin- istered
  Summary:           Interferon produced in response to the initial dose of measles virus vaccine has been postulated to inhibit replication of vaccinia virus in the subsequent vaccine dose. The possibility that two doses of the same or different live virus vaccines administered within too short an interval may inhibit the immunologic response is based on evidence from animal and human studies.

  Keywords:          measles, infants months, measles vaccine, maternal, maternal antibody, infants, tinely, depends rate, timing administration, optimal timing
  Summary:           The optimal timing for administration of measles vaccine depends on the rate of disappearance of passively acquired maternal antibody and the risk of exposure to measles virus.
