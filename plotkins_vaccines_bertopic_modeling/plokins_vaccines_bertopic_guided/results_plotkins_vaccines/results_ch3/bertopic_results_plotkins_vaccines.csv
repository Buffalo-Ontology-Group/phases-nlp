"The determination of a correlate of protection (CoP) by a vaccine is often critical to its development, as its measurement permits a number of both theoretical and practical extrapola- tions. Aside from the intellectual interest in identifying the immune response that is protective, knowledge of a CoP permits measurement of consistent lot potency of a vaccine and differentiation of susceptible from immune individuals. If an infection is uncommon or deadly, such that an efficacy trial is not feasible or ethical, a CoP may yet enable licensure of a vaccine, and once established, a CoP will allow bridging from one vaccine preparation to another.",17,Vaccine,Vaccine – Protection,1.0

Principle 2: The Mechanism of Protection by Vaccination Is Not Necessarily the Same Mechanism as Recovery From Infection,1,Vaccination,Vaccination,1.0
"Vaccination against poliomyelitis is usually highly effective in the prevention of paralysis, as stated above, because of the induction of serum antibody. A study challenged subjects previously given live vaccine and killed vaccine with two different doses of the oral live vaccine: 800 or 600,000 TCID50 (median tissue culture infective dose). The live vaccine recipients were infected by the low-dose challenge 3% of the time and by the high-dose challenge 15% of the time, whereas 30% of the killed vaccine recipients could be infected by a low dose and 70% by a high dose, indicating that high challenge doses can overcome intestinal immunity.14",6,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination – T6,0.8046099080080179
"Another challenge study involved an experimental cyto- megalovirus vaccine. The vaccine prevented infection by 100 PFU of the challenge virus, but not by 1000 PFU.15",14,Cytomegalovirus,Cytomegalovirus,1.0
"Table 3.2 lists the commonly used licensed vaccines and their predominant mechanisms for causing disease. Only in the cases of zoster and tuberculosis vaccines does it appear that antibodies are not the primary mecha- nism of control, but that stimulation of specific T-cell subsets correlate with protection.16 Aside from these theoret- Indeed, the efficacy of hepatitis A vaccine was pre- dictable from the fact that induced antibody levels are a thousand times higher than those shown to protect after administration of gamma globulin.17 As mentioned under Principle 1, higher levels of antibody are necessary to prevent mucosal colonization than disease, as for example, in the case of pharyngeal colonization after Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine.18",7,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antibodies,1.0
"Although high levels of antibodies are more protective than lower levels, after some vaccines breakthroughs may occur at high levels, even if less frequently than at lower levels. At an anti-HA (hemagglutinin) titer of 1/40, generally thought to be an acceptable response, only approximately 50% of vaccine recipients are protected; even at titers four times higher, breakthrough infections occur.19 Similarly, high levels of pertussis antitoxin after immunization was related to protection both in household exposures and nonhousehold exposures, but mild disease occurred at inter- mediate levels of antibody.",7,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antibodies,1.0

"It has usually been assumed that T-cell responses are the important protective correlate for bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and tuberculosis in general, but it has been difficult to prove that assumption. However, although pre- sumably related to T-cell function, it is uncertain as to which, and the mCoP for tuberculosis vaccine in humans remains elusive.28–30 On the other hand, malaria is an example where T-cell responses appear to be crucial, and although antibodies to circumsporozoite protein (CSP) are also generated, they do not appear to be a CoP.31,32 The RTS,S particle containing CSP generates tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α producing CD4+ cells that appear to predict protection.33 In contrast, a vaccine based on intravenous injection of irradiated sporozoites depends for efficacy on CSP induction of CD8+ T cells that produce inter- feron in the liver, where natural sporozoites must first replicate to launch infection.34",0,Malaria,Malaria,1.0

"The current vaccine consists of live varicella virus in large quantity or the gE protein of the virus. In both cases the vaccines elicit both antibodies and cellular responses. This suggests that the cellular immunity is an mCoP, whereas the antibody is an nCoP, which makes sense if the vaccines maintain the viral latency in the dorsal root ganglia, but it is not impossible that the neutralization of virus by antibody in the skin is also important.",7,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antibodies,1.0

"response biomarker measured after vaccination that can be used to reliably predict vaccine efficacy (VE) against a clinical end point. Several approaches to defining and statistically evaluating CoPs based on efficacy trials have been pro- posed.4,91–103 For CoP assessment, these approaches have been applied to search for thresholds of the biomarker that dis- criminate vaccinees into disease cases (and hence unprotected) versus undiseased controls (and hence putatively pro- tected),9,104–108 or to study how protection depends on the distribution of response.109–111 However, many of these CoP methods do not define protected biomarker subgroups in terms of a causal effect of vaccination, such that an association of the biomarker with disease may not reflect a correlation with VE but rather with pathogen exposure or intrinsic sus- ceptibility to the disease.4,112–115 Addressing this limitation, the “VE curve” approach directly assesses how VE varies across vaccinated subgroups defined by the level of the bio- marker.4,113–119 With this approach, the most useful CoP has VE of zero for vaccinees with negative/absent immune response and VE near 100% for vaccinees with response above a thresh- old. A varicella zoster vaccine (VZV) efficacy trial120 illustrates this approach, where VE to prevent herpes zoster varied widely with fold rise in VZV antibody titers (P < .001), with estimated VE of 90% for vaccinees with a 5.26-fold rise compared to 70% and 0% for vaccinees with a 2.39- and zero-fold rise, respec- tively.6",18,Vaccine,Vaccine – Efficacy,1.0

The “closeout placebo vac- cination” technique crosses over placebo recipients at the end of study follow-up to receive the vaccine and have the immune response directly measured.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Second, statistical methods are needed to develop cocorre- lates, for example, by estimating VE surfaces across vaccinee subgroups defined by the level of two immune response bio- markers114,119 or estimating VE curves for a univariable com- posite biomarker.126 Moreover, for assessing complex correlates3 based on high-dimensional immune response biomarkers, supervised machine learning methods are needed to estimate the best models of VE.88,89,141,142 Third, two types of CoP analy- ses are defined by measuring the immune response biomarker at a fixed time point shortly after vaccination or at serial time points including just before exposure and infection or disease. Fourth, a highly predictive CoP for a particular disease end point, vac- cine, and study population may fail for a different end point, vaccine, or study population,143 indicating that metaanalysis of multiple efficacy trials combined with knowledge of mecha- nisms of protection is needed for bridging CoPs to new settings.4,55,94,97,106,115,144,145",18,Vaccine,Vaccine – Efficacy,1.0
"Lastly, for genetically diverse pathogens, the whole discus- sion above applies to assessing CoPs against particular pheno- types or genotypes of the pathogen (e.g., through pathogen type-specific VE curves), with common application historically to assess serotype- or biotype-specific antibody titers as CoPs against disease with the same type.146–151 In contemporary effi- cacy trials, pathogen genomes infecting study participants are sequenced, enabling a statistical sieve analysis that assesses how VE varies with sequence characteristics.152 Immune response data can inform the sieve analysis by focusing the analysis on putatively protective epitopes such as highly vaccine-reactive peptides or specific reagents that were identi- fied as CoPs.153,154 Moreover, host characteristics other than immune responses (such as demographics, ecological factors, or genetics such as human leukocyte antigen [HLA] types restricting epitope-specific T-cell responses) may affect VE or type-specific VE, such that the overarching goal of VE curve CoP analysis may be stated as estimation of how VE varies jointly in pathogen sequence characteristics, immune response biomarkers, and any other host characteristics.3,73,87,155",18,Vaccine,Vaccine – Efficacy,1.0

Whereas as described above, the canarypox vector/HIV protein vaccine for HIV depends for its efficacy on an ADCC antibody response,156 a rhesus cytomegalovirus vectored vaccine that protected monkeys against SIV acts through induction of effector T cells.66,67 In the case of human cytomegalovirus antibody to surface proteins protect against acquisition by contact,169 but cellular immunity to internal antigens seems to be key in preventing transplant-associated disease in hematogenous stem cell recipients.170",0,Malaria,Malaria,0.8139667410990757
