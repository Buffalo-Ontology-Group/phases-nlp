  Keywords:          rts, malaria, malaria vaccine, t cell, cell responses, protein, t, circumsporozoite protein, plasmodium, rts malaria
  Summary:           It has usually been assumed that T-cell responses are the important protective correlate for bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and tuberculosis in general. However, although pre- sumably related to T- cell function, it is uncertain as to which, and the mCoP for tuberculosis vaccine in humans remains elusive.
