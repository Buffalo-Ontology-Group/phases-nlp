"tion would not have occurred if it were not for his earlier work that focused on characterizing the protective mechanisms of active immunization against diphtheria5,8 and through the work of his collaborator, Kitasato, on the mechanisms of vaccine-mediated immunity against tetanus.1 When guinea pigs were infected with Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the animals routinely died of the disease.",0,Vaccination,Vaccination,1.0
"Likewise, agammaglobulinemic patients also begin to present with symptoms of immunodeficiency around this same age.17 Maternal antibodies represent an immunological “double- edged sword” in the sense that they are known to interfere with live attenuated virus vaccines such as the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)18–20 and rotavirus vaccines,21,22 whereas direct immunization of mothers in the third trimester of pregnancy can significantly increase protection of infants against common respiratory viruses such as influenza.23–25 Indeed, maternal vac- cination may result in a 45% to 91% reduction in influenza- related hospitalizations among infants younger than 6 months of age.23–25 Likewise, the importance of maternal vaccination against Bordetella pertussis (i.e., whooping cough) was recog- nized as early as the 1930s to 1940s with studies showing higher antibacterial antibody responses and potential protec- tion from exposure to whooping cough among infants born to vaccinated mothers.26–29 Recent studies verify these earlier results, demonstrating a 90% to 91% vaccine efficacy against whooping cough among infants younger than 2 months of",0,Vaccination,Vaccination,1.0
"age who were born to mothers who received pertussis vaccina- tion during pregnancy,30,31 thus lending further support to the current recommendations for the vaccination of pregnant mothers against B. pertussis.32 The age limit of younger than 2 months was chosen as this is the age at which primary pedi- atric vaccination is recommended and analysis beyond this age might be confounded by the protective effects of direct vaccination of the child. Nevertheless, the protection afforded by maternally derived IgG against respiratory infections involving viral (e.g., influenza) or bacterial (e.g., B. pertussis) pathogens together demonstrate the broad impact that mater- nal vaccination and the subsequently increased transfer of maternal antibodies can have on the health of young infants.",0,Vaccination,Vaccination,1.0
"Before vaccines and antibiotics revolutionized modern medi- cine, antibody-based therapies represented the only effective medical treatment for many life-threatening diseases includ- ing diphtheria, scarlet fever, bacterial meningitis, and bacterial pneumonia.33,34 Today, most commercial forms of antibody- based immunotherapy for infectious disease still rely on poly- clonal antibodies of human or animal origin, with the notable exceptions of the monoclonal antibodies, palivizumab and raxibacumab (see Table 8.1).",0,Vaccination,Vaccination,1.0
"Interestingly, serum IgG (and serum IgA) responses elicited in response to vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis correlate strongly with the levels of antibacterial antibodies present in the saliva at 1 month and 1 year after vaccination,45 indicating that circulating serum antibodies may be an important contributor to the antibodies released in mucosal secretions.",0,Vaccination,Vaccination,1.0
"When vaccinia-immune gammaglobulin (VIG) was administered to smallpox contacts prior to disease onset in addition to postexposure vaccination (i.e., standard of care), the number of smallpox cases was reduced by 70% compared to contacts who received postexposure smallpox vaccination alone.64 Likewise, administration of vaccinia- immune serum of animal origin along with postexposure vaccination resulted in 0 of 13 cases (0%) of smallpox among close contacts compared to 13 of 29 cases (45%) among con- trols who received smallpox vaccination alone.65 During a smallpox outbreak in 1941, 3 of 10 patients (30%) died while undergoing standard clinical care.66 To determine if addition of passive immunotherapy would reduce mortality after smallpox diagnosis, 250 cases of smallpox were treated with convalescent serum or blood, with no smallpox- associated deaths reported (0 of 250).",0,Vaccination,Vaccination,1.0
"Influenza is a significant cause of morbid- ity and mortality throughout the world, including both sea- sonal transmission and pandemic outbreaks.85–88 The clinical correlation between homotypic influenza immunity and vaccine-associated protection was recognized early in the development of the influenza vaccine.89–91",3,Vaccines,Vaccines,1.0

"observed between maternally derived rotavirus antibodies and the ability of infants to seroconvert following vaccination with a live rotavirus vaccine.21 This is an important demonstration not only of passive immunity to an enteric pathogen, but also has broader implications on the timing of vaccine administra- tion, especially in developing countries where preexisting immunity is relatively high, and rotavirus vaccine immunoge- nicity appears impaired.109",2,Rotavirus,Rotavirus,1.0

"sufficient for protection or therapeutic intervention of acute or remittent disease, active immunization through improved vaccine design may still be needed to train the host immune system to maintain long-term levels of protective immunity. Importantly, examples of successful passive immunization approaches may provide a useful framework for developing new and improved vaccines that elicit the most protective antibody responses.",0,Vaccination,Vaccination,1.0
