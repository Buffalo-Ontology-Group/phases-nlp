  Summary:           Maternal antibodies represent an immunological “double- edged sword” in the sense that they are known to interfere with live attenuated virus vaccines such as the MMR. Direct immunization of mothers in the third trimester of pregnancy can significantly increase protection of infants against common respiratory viruses such as influenza.
