  Auto Label:        Pertussis
  Descriptive Label: Pertussis
  Keywords:          acellular, pertussis, acellular pertussis, pertussis vaccine, pertussis vaccines, neonatal, ifn, neonatal priming, γ, immunization acellular
  Summary:           Neonatal priming with a combined DTaP vaccine blunted rather than primed subsequent infant pertussis responses. Neonatal and infant T-cell responses also differ from those elicited later in life.

Topic 1
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Immune
  Keywords:          new, correlates, nonspecific, nature vaccine, vaccine antibody, population, questions, assess, development new, responses nonlive
  Summary:           New methods have emerged allowing the assessment of a growing number of vaccine-associated immune parameters, including in humans. The nature of the vaccine exerts a direct influence on the type of immune effectors that are elicited and that mediate protec- tive efficacy.

Topic 2
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Immunization
  Keywords:          maternal, maternal antibodies, postnatal, influence, inhibitory, infant, inhibitory influence, influence maternal, infant antibody, antibody
  Summary:           Early life antibody responses are directly determined by the prenatal (e.g., gestational age238) and the postnatal age at immunization. Accelerated infant vaccine schedules in which three vaccine doses are given at 1-month intervals result in lower immune responses.

Topic 3
  Auto Label:        Peptides
  Descriptive Label: Peptides
  Keywords:          term efficacy, study, response vaccine, randomized, randomized trial, term immunogenicity, long term, term, recombinant, peptides
  Summary:           Pro- gression to chronic liver disease has not been reported in fully immunized vaccine responders. Co-administration of CpG oligonucleotides enhances the late affinity maturation process of human anti–hepatitis B vaccine response.

Topic 4
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Immunology
  Keywords:          measles, measles vaccine, mortality, rubella, mumps, month old, old infants, vaccine, old, immunity induced
  Summary:           There is indirect evidence that vaccine-induced T cells contribute to the protection conferred by other vaccines. The understanding of vaccine immunology requires appraising how B- and T-cell responses are elicited, supported, maintained, and/or reacti- vated.

Topic 5
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Conjugate
  Keywords:          glycoconjugate vaccines, glycoconjugate, protein, carrier, conjugate vaccines, conjugate, polysaccharide, carriers, markedly, bacterial vaccines
  Summary:           The conjugation of bacterial PS to a protein carrier (e.g., glyco- conjugate vaccines) provides foreign peptide antigens that are presented to the immune system. A protein that is used as a template to which polysaccharide moieties are chemically conjugated to generate glycoconjugate vaccines.

Topic 6
  Auto Label:        Vaccine
  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Influenzae
  Keywords:          influenzae, influenzae type, type, type b, conjugate, haemophilus, vaccine failure, conjugate vaccine, acellular pertussis, failure
  Summary:           A window of 4 to 7 days after H. influenzae b (Hib) PS immuni- zation was reported as sufficient for high levels of PS-specific vaccine antibodies to appear in the blood of previously primed infants.

Topic 7
  Auto Label:        Vaccine
  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Pneumococcal
  Keywords:          pneumococcal, pneumococcal polysaccharide, polysaccharide, pneumococcal conjugate, polysaccharide vaccine, valent pneumococcal, valent, conjugate, vaccine pneumococcal, conjugate vaccine
  Summary:           Pneumococcal conju- gate and plain polysaccharide vaccines have divergent effects on antigen-specific B cells. Cellular CD4 T cell responses to the diphtheria-derived carrier protein of conjugated pneumo- coccal vaccine and antibody response to pneumococcal vaccina- tion in HIV-infected adults.

Topic 8
  Auto Label:        Vaccines
  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Antigens
  Keywords:          adjuvants, innate immunity, vaccine adjuvants, innate, nonlive, activate, signals, danger signals, danger, nonlive vaccines
  Summary:           The induction of antigen-specific B- and T-cell responses requires their activation in the draining lymph nodes by specific antigen-presenting cells (APCs) The very first requirement to elicit vaccine responses is to provide sufficient “danger signals” through vaccine antigens and/or adjuvants to trigger an inflammatory reaction.

Topic 9
  Auto Label:        Vaccine
  Descriptive Label: Vaccine – Immune
  Keywords:          vaccine antigens, antigens, t, cells, b cell, surface, b, cell, cd8, lymphocytes
  Summary:           Vaccines protect by inducing effector mechanisms (cells or molecules) capable of rapidly controlling replicating patho- gens or inactivating their toxic components. Vaccine-induced immune effectors (Table 2.1) are essentially antibodies produced by B lymphocytes.

Topic 10
  Auto Label:        Immunization
  Descriptive Label: Immunization
  Keywords:          changes, age, elderly, antibody, extremes, antibody responses, responses, aged, healthy elderly, extremes age
  Summary:           Age at immunization also modulates vaccine antibody per- sistence, which is shorter at the two extremes of life. Certain conditions may also limit the persistence of vaccine antibody responses because of enhanced catabo- lism.

  Summary:           Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) may play a more critical role than previously anticipated for specific diseases like pertussis. Specific T cell frequency and cytokine expression profile do not correlate with protection against tuberculosis.

  Summary:           A single dose of the AS03-adjuvanted influenza H1N1/09 vaccine in healthy children elicited anti- body responses similar to those observed in convalescent chil- dren48. Formulating the varicella-zoster-virus IgE protein into the novel AS01b adjuvant system conferred unprece- dented vaccine efficacy in the elderly.

  Descriptive Label: Vaccines – Immunization – T30
  Keywords:          phenomenon, ps, b cell, given, known triggering, ence given, replenished, reported70–73, formal demonstration, sequently
  Summary:           Induction of antigen-specific immune effectors by an immunization process does not imply that these antibodies, cells, or cytokines rep- resent surrogates—or even correlates—of vaccine efficacy. This requires the formal demonstration that vaccine-mediated pro- tection is dependent on the pres- ence of a given marker.
