"To generate vaccine-mediated protection is a complex chal- lenge. Currently available vaccines have largely been devel- oped empirically, with little or no understanding of how they activate the immune system. However, there is more to antibody- mediated protection than the peak of vaccine-induced antibody titers. Long-term protection requires the persistence of vaccine antibodies above protective thresholds and/or the maintenance of immune memory cells capable of rapid and effective reactivation with subsequent microbial exposure. The determinants of immune memory induction, as well as the relative contribution of persisting antibodies and of immune memory to protection against spe- cific diseases, are essential parameters of long-term vaccine efficacy.",19,Vaccines,Vaccines – Protection,1.0
"vaccines should not overshadow the importance of T-cell responses: T cells are essential to the induction of high-affinity antibodies and immune memory, directly contribute to the protection conferred by current vaccines such as bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), may play a more critical role than previously anticipated for specific diseases like pertussis, and will be the prime effectors against novel vaccine targets with predominant intracellular localization such as tuberculosis.",20,Vaccination,Vaccination,1.0
"New methods have emerged allowing the assessment of a growing number of vaccine-associated immune parameters, including in humans. This development raises new questions about the optimal markers to assess and their correlation with vaccine-induced protection. The identification of mechanistic immune correlates—or at least surrogates—of vaccine efficacy is a major asset for the development of new vaccines or the optimization of immunization strategies using available vac- cines. During the last decade, the increased awareness of the complexity of the immune system and its determinants, including at the host genetic level, indicated that using system biology approaches to assess how various processes and networks interact in response to immunization could prove more illustrative than trying to isolate and char- acterize a few components of vaccine responses.1 Delineating the specific molecular signatures of vaccine immunogenicity is beginning to highlight novel correlates of protective immu- nity and better explain the heterogeneity of vaccine responses in a population. The tailoring of vaccine strategies for specific vulnerable populations, including very young, elderly, and immunosuppressed populations, also largely relies on a better understanding of what supports or limits vaccine efficacy under special circumstances—at the population and individ- ual levels. Lastly, the exponential development of new vaccines raises many questions that are not limited to the targeted diseases and the potential impacts of their prevention, but that address the specific and nonspecific impacts of such vaccines on the immune system and, thus, on health in general. These immune-related concerns have largely spread into the population, and questions related to the immunological safety of vaccines—that is, their capacity for triggering",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immune,0.9798463452938361

"Vaccines protect by inducing effector mechanisms (cells or molecules) capable of rapidly controlling replicating patho- gens or inactivating their toxic components. Vaccine-induced immune effectors (Table 2.1) are essentially antibodies— produced by B lymphocytes—capable of binding specifically to a toxin or a pathogen.2 Other potential effectors are cyto- toxic CD8+ T lymphocytes that may limit the spread of infec- tious agents by recognizing and killing infected cells or secreting specific antiviral cytokines and CD4+ T-helper (Th) lymphocytes. A recently identified critical subset of vaccine-induced CD4+ Th cells are follicular T-helper (Tfh) cells: they are spe- cially equipped and positioned in the lymph nodes to support potent B-cell activation and differentiation into antibody- secreting-cells4 and were identified as directly controlling anti- body responses and mediating adjuvanticity.5–7 Another important subset are T-helper 17 (Th17) cells which essen- tially defend against extracellular bacteria that colonize the skin and mucosa, recruiting neutrophils and promoting local inflammation.8,9 These effectors are controlled by regulatory T cells (Tregs) involved in maintaining immune tolerance.10 Most antigens and vaccines trigger B- and T-cell responses, such that there is no rationale in opposing vaccines favoring antibody production (“humoral immunity”) and T-cell responses (“cellular immunity”).",9,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immune,0.5178344962999764

In addition, live attenuated vaccines usually generate CD8+ cyto- toxic T cells.

"The induction of antigen-specific immune effectors (and/ or of immune memory cells) by an immunization process does not imply that these antibodies, cells, or cytokines rep- resent surrogates—or even correlates—of vaccine efficacy. This requires the formal demonstration that vaccine-mediated pro- tection is dependent—in a vaccinated person—on the pres- ence of a given marker such as an antibody titer or a number of antigen-specific cells above a given threshold.17,18",30,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunization – T30,1.0
"Antigen-specific antibodies have been formally demon- strated as conferring vaccine-induced protection against many diseases19 (see Table 2.2). They may reduce binding or adhe- sion to susceptible cells or receptors and limit viral replication (e.g., polio) or reduce bacterial colonization (glycoconjugate vaccines against encapsulated bacteria) if present at suffi- ciently high titers on mucosal surfaces.20 The neutralization of pathogens at mucosal surfaces is mainly achieved by the transudation of vaccine-induced serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies.",26,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antibodies,0.6791508732004746

"Current vaccines mostly mediate protection through the induction of highly specific IgG serum antibodies (see Table 2.2). Live oral or nasal vaccines, such as rotavirus, oral polio, nasal influenza, or cholera vaccines, induce serum IgA and secretory IgA, which also help limit viral shedding on mucosal surfaces.",26,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antibodies,1.0
"However, there is indirect evidence that vaccine-induced T cells contribute to the protection conferred by other vaccines. CD4+ T cells seem to support the persistence of protection against clinical pertus- sis in children primed in infancy, after vaccine-induced anti- bodies have waned,25–28 and may contribute to the longer vaccine efficacy of whole-cell pertussis vaccines.29–31 Another example is that of measles immunization in 6-month-old infants in whom antibody responses largely are not initiated because of immune immaturity and/or the residual presence of inhibitory maternal antibodies, but significant interferon (IFN)-γ–producing CD4+ T cells are generated.32,33 The infants remain susceptible to measles infection but are protected against severe disease and death, presumably because of the viral clearance capacity of their vaccine-induced T-cell effec- tors. Thus, prevention of infection may be achieved only by vaccine-induced antibodies, whereas disease attenuation and protection against complications may be supported by T cells, even in the absence of specific antibodies. The understanding of vaccine immunology requires appraising how B- and T-cell responses are elicited, supported, maintained, and/or reacti- vated by vaccine antigens.",4,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunology,1.0
"Novel adjuvants essentially enhance vaccine responses by modulating innate immunity, which shapes adaptive responses.34–38 Indeed, the induction of antigen-specific B- and T-cell responses requires their activation in the draining lymph nodes by specific antigen-presenting cells (APCs), essentially dendritic cells (DCs) that must be recruited into the reaction. The central role for mature DCs in the induction of vaccine responses reflects their unique capacity to provide antigen-specific, costimulation signals to T cells; these “danger signals” are required to activate naïve T cells.39 The very first requirement to elicit vaccine responses is to provide sufficient “danger signals” through vaccine antigens and/or adjuvants (Fig. 2.1) to trigger an inflammatory reaction that is mediated by cells of the innate immune system.34–37",8,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antigens,0.9552888824842887
"Live viral vaccines most efficiently trigger the activation of the innate immune system through multiple pathogen- associated signals (such as viral RNA), allowing their recognition by pattern-recognition receptors (see Table 2.3).41 This pattern is very similar to that occurring after a natural infection, including the initial mucosal replication stage for vaccines administered through the nasal and oral routes. This sequence provides a second explanation of the generally higher immunogenicity of live versus “nonlive” vaccines (Table 2.4).42 Another consequence of this early dif- fusion pattern is that the site and route of injection of live viral vaccines are of minor importance; for example, the immuno- genicity and reactogenicity of measles vaccine is similar fol- lowing intramuscular or subcutaneous injection,43 and measles vaccine may be administered by aerosol.",26,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antibodies,1.0

"In the absence of microbial replication, however, vaccine-induced activation remains more limited, in both time and space. Nonlive vaccines essentially activate innate responses at their site of injection (see Fig. 2.1). This advantage of the dermal DC concentration is applied to the prevention of rabies in many countries and could prove useful against additional targets as novel microneedle and needle-free devices become available for intradermal administration.44 Patrolling DCs are also numerous in well-vascularized muscles, which is the preferred route of injection for nonlive vaccines. They are fewer in adipose tissues, such that subcutaneous injections may be less effective than intramuscular injections under conditions of limited immunogenicity, as demonstrated for adult immunization against hepatitis B.45 Despite many efforts, immunization through the mucosal route remains limited to a few live vaccines. The extreme difficulty in produc- ing nonlive mucosal vaccines reflects the need to overcome a large number of physical, immunological, and chemical bar- riers, which requires the use of live vaccines or strong adju- vants. This fact is not trivial, as unfortunately illustrated by the association of a novel adjuvanted inactivated intranasal influ- enza vaccine with Bell palsy.46",8,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antigens,1.0

Notably, secondary vaccine failures have been relatively rare and primarily observed in countries using an early accelerated infant schedule without a booster dose,150 the use of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP)/Hib vaccines with lower Hib immunogenicity is also associated with vaccine failure.151 Similarly, glycoconjugate vaccines against group C meningococcal disease proved much more efficacious during the first year after infant priming than during the following 3 years.141 Thus, infant immunization fails to induce sustained protection against group C meningococcus, despite the induction and persistence of immune memory.152 The requirement for boosters to confer long-term vaccine pro- tection is also well illustrated for pertussis, for which boosters are required to extend protection beyond childhood.153 An interesting observation is that vaccine-induced memory per- sists following pertussis immunization—as illustrated by anamnestic responses to a booster dose—but is not sufficient for protection.",19,Vaccines,Vaccines – Protection,0.8159376542265826

Ideally, one would want vaccine-induced responses to be sufficiently broad to extend protection to nonvaccine strains (e.g., for influenza, rotavirus, S. pneumoniae, or HPV vaccines) and sufficiently restricted to not elicit cross-reactions to allergens or self-antigens or other undesirable nonspecific effects. The specificity of vaccine responses has received added interest as a number of studies have also reported both posi- tive and negative “nonspecific” effects of vaccinations in low income countries.195,196",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immune,0.9964715452987359
"Vaccination with tetanus toxoid was found to expand specific and bystander memory T cells but did not modulate antibody responses to unrelated antigens.198 Altogether, this indicates that the induction of cross-reactive antibody responses is extremely limited, which may be impor- tant in preventing undesirable reactions, but which limits the efficacy of vaccine-induced antibody responses to very few cross-reacting nonvaccine serotypes.199",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"It has been esti- mated that each T lymphocyte could potentially bind to a million different peptides.197 In addition, memory T cells readily respond to homeostatic cytokines, such that bystander memory T cells of distinct antigen specificity may be tran- siently activated and expand during a flu-like illness or an immunization process.198,200 However, vaccine-induced exac- erbations of autoimmune diseases are very uncommon, probably reflecting the efficacy of regulatory mechanisms limiting the intensity, scope, and duration of the immune responses.201,202",11,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immune – T11,1.0
"which suggests that cross-reacting viral vaccines could be based on T-cell responses.203 Yet, convincing examples of het- erologous protective immunity in humans are much more limited, including neonatal BCG protects against leprosy,204 and smallpox vaccine protects against monkeypox.205 In con- trast, the sharing of several T-cell determinants is not sufficient for a single oral polio vaccine strain or influenza strain to confer cross-protection.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Nonspecific effects of vaccines are occasionally associated with the fear of immune overload and subsequent enhanced vulnerability to infections, a theory not supported by evidence.208,209",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immune,1.0
"The epidemiological studies on this subject have been done mainly by a group working in Guinea-Bissau and their thesis is that live vaccines (including BCG, measles, and oral polio vaccine [OPV]) can reduce mor- tality caused by respiratory viral infections, whereas killed vaccines, notably diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), can reverse those effects and even increase mortality.210–213 Data from some other regions are supportive of this theory.214,215 As most of the epidemiological studies have been nonrandom- ized studies, this idea has been met with skepticism, particu- larly as the causes of mortality have been ill-defined. Following a systematic review, the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization concluded that the available data suggest that BCG “has” and measles vaccine “may have” beneficial effects on all-cause mortality, whereas it neither excluded nor confirmed the pos- sibility of beneficial or deleterious nonspecific effects of DTP vaccines on all-cause mortality.216,217",4,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunology,0.7129117405858604
"sion.223,224 Wild measles virus infection in monkeys abolishes immune memory to other antigens,225,226 making it possible that measles vaccine in addition prevents abolition by the natural virus of the child’s ability to respond to other infec- tions.227 The proposed negative effects of killed vaccines on mortality remains for the moment based only on observa- tion,228 although nonlive vaccines typically elicit preferential Th2 responses which might hypothetically reduce the Th1 polarization elicited by live vaccines.",4,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunology,1.0
Vaccine Responses at the Extremes of Age,10,Immunization,Immunization,1.0
"This disease burden is caused by a limited number of patho- gens, such that the availability of a few additional vaccines that would be immunogenic soon after birth would make a huge difference.",17,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunogenic,1.0
"In addition, many factors determine the quality and quantity of infant antibody responses: this includes the state of prenatal and postnatal development of the immune system, the type of vaccine and its immunogenicity, the number of doses and their spacing, and the influence of maternal antibodies.232–234",2,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunization,0.9760132698058978
"Although this may be circumvented in part by the use of glycoconjugate vaccines, even the most potent glycoconjugate vaccines elicit markedly lower primary IgG responses in young infants.237",5,Vaccines,Vaccines – Conjugate,0.9850160329907451
"Early life antibody responses are directly determined by the prenatal (e.g., gestational age238) and the postnatal age at immunization.236 Accelerated infant vaccine schedules in which three vaccine doses are given at 1-month intervals (2, 3, 4 or 3, 4, 5 months) result in lower immune responses than schedules in which more time elapses between doses (2, 4, 6 months) or between the priming and boosting dose (3, 5, 12 months). However, the magnitude of infant antibody responses to multiple dose schedules reflects the interval between doses, with longer intervals eliciting stronger responses, and the age at which the last vaccine dose is admin- istered. That postnatal immune maturation is required for stronger antibody responses is best demonstrated by compar- ing antibody responses to single-dose vaccines given to anti- gen-naïve infants of various ages.239,240 These studies may be confounded by the persistence of maternal antibodies, which negatively influence infant antibody responses in both epitope and titer specific manners.241,242 Thus, multivariate analyses of the data for a large number of infants are required to identify the main determinants of vaccine antibody responses.243",2,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunization,1.0
"Studies in which vaccines rou- tinely administered to human infants were administered at various stages of the postnatal maturation to infant mice indi- cated that the same limitations of antibody responses are seen in both humans and mice, reflecting similar postnatal con- straints.236 These animal models showed that limitations of antibody responses in early life result from the limited and delayed induction of GCs in which antigen-specific B cells proliferate and differentiate.",2,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunization,1.0
The capacity of the MF59 adju- vant to induce strong Tfh/GC responses in infant mice7 could also be relevant to the ability of the adjuvant to improve the efficacy of influenza vaccines in young children.246,21,Influenza,Influenza – Vaccines – T21,1.0
"Neonatal priming may, thus, be used to initiate vaccine responses against hepatitis B or polio- myelitis. Recent work demonstrated that acellular pertussis vaccines may similarly effectively prime neonatal responses, resulting in faster acquisition of infant immunity.247–249 However, neonatal priming with a combined DTaP vaccine blunted rather than primed subsequent infant pertussis responses,250 and somewhat reduced Hib and HBsAg responses were also seen following neonatal acellular pertussis priming.248,251 Thus, vaccine interference issues may be exacer- bated in early postnatal life, requiring further studies.252",0,Pertussis,Pertussis,1.0

"Neonatal and infant T-cell responses also differ from those elicited later in life, in particular in the induction of lower IFN-γ236 and higher Th2 and/or Th17 responses.258 As exam- ples, IFN-γ responses to OPV are significantly lower in infants than in adults259; hepatitis B vaccine induces lower primary IFN-γ responses and higher secondary Th2 responses in early life than in adults260; and tetanus-specific IFN-γ CD4+ T-cell responses progressively increase with age.261 Comparing neo- natal and infant priming with acellular pertussis vaccines indi- cated the preferential induction of Th2 responses on neonatal priming.262 Whether this results from the fact that neonatal APC responses to Toll-like and other pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors produce less IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12p70, and more IL-10 than adult cells,263–265 or result from complex epigenetic controls or the predominance of recent thymic emigrants in neonatal blood,266 is unknown.",0,Pertussis,Pertussis,1.0

"infant B-cell responses affects all vaccine types, although its influence is more marked for live attenuated viral vaccines that may be neutralized by even minute amounts of passive antibodies.271 However, responses to conjugate vaccines may be blunted if anticarrier immunity is required for immunogenic- ity (e.g., for CRM197 conjugates) and maternal antibodies inter- fere with its induction.275 Maternal antibodies were reported as inhibiting cotton-rat B-cell responses by interaction with the inhibitory/regulatory FcγRIIB receptor on antigen-specific B cells.276,277",2,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunization,1.0

"The extent and duration of the inhibitory influence of maternal antibodies, therefore, increase with gestational age,238 for example, with the amount of transferred immuno- globulins, and decline with postnatal age, as maternal anti- bodies wane.90 Increasing the dose of vaccine antigen may be sufficient to circumvent the inhibitory influence of maternal antibodies, as illustrated for hepatitis A,279 measles,280 and the higher content of pertussis toxin in acellular versus whole-cell pertussis281 vaccines.",2,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunization,1.0
"Importantly, maternal antibodies do not exert their inhibitory influence on infant T-cell responses, which remain largely unaffected or even enhanced.283–285 This is best explained by the fate of maternal antibody–vaccine antigen complexes: immune complexes are taken up by macrophages and DCs, dissociate into their acidic phagolysosome compart- ment, and are processed into small peptides.",2,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunization,1.0
"Thus, the main challenge for further improvement of early life immunization strategies are to identify vaccine formula- tions and strategies capable of inducing, after one or two early doses, the strong primary antibody responses required against certain early life pathogens—despite the presence of maternal antibodies.",2,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunization,0.7559086103480906

"responses decline with age, which increases the frequency and severity of infections and reduces the protective effects of vaccinations.287 Aging affects the magnitude and the persistence of antibody responses to protein vaccines,288,289 as reflected by lower serum antibodies to influenza,290,291 tetanus, and tick- borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccines.292 It also affects responses to pneumococcal PS vaccines, although differences in method- ological issues have yielded contradictory results.293 Remark- ably, the limitation of antibody responses by aging occurs early: After the age of 20 years, each 10-year period reduced antibody titers elicited by a potent adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine in healthy control subjects and immunosuppressed patients by 31%.294 Limitations of antibody responses in elderly people are also associated with qualitative changes that affect antibody specificity, isotype, and affinity, that is, functional efficacy (see Table 2.10).295,296",10,Immunization,Immunization,0.6825306016546272
"lying events.232,297 Responses to PS vaccines are conditioned by a decline in the reservoir of IgM+ memory B cells that differ- entiate less efficiently into antibody producing cells, and, thus, limit the IgM responses of aged people.298 Antibody responses relying on the induction of GCs are also limited,299 affecting the magnitude of antibody responses and resulting into anti- bodies of weaker affinities/functional capacities296 and distri- bution of subclass antibodies.300 Numerous factors contribute to limiting the induction of GCs in elderly persons, including factors that are intrinsic to B cells301 and that affect other cell types, including Tfh cells.302 For example, studies in aged mice have convincingly demonstrated the existence of age-related changes in FDCs.303,304 The limited ability of aged subjects to generate high-affinity antibody responses also reflects changes in their antibody repertoire.304,305",10,Immunization,Immunization,0.5572087916154794

This was recently demonstrated by formulating the IgE glyco- protein of varicella-zoster in the novel AS01E adjuvant.24 Nev- ertheless, limitations of effector memory and of GC responses may continue to require the more frequent administration of certain vaccine boosters (e.g., against tetanus or TBE308) to compensate for the brevity of B- and T-cell vaccine-induced responses in elderly people.",25,Vaccine,Vaccine – Influenza,0.7966855410947502
