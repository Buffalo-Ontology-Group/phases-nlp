The Vaccine Industry,5,Vaccine,Vaccine – Business,1.0
"The vaccine industry is composed of companies that are engaged in any of the following activities: research (including that performed in industry and biotech), development, manu- facture, or sales, marketing, and distribution of vaccines. They receive their revenue chiefly from sales of vaccine products or expectations thereof. The vaccine industry is relatively small, compared to the pharmaceutical industry, but growing. We estimate that total infectious disease vaccine sales in 2013 were more than $25 billion worldwide and expected to grow to about $35 billion by 2020. Although components of the vaccine industry are found in 50 countries worldwide, the large vaccine companies are primarily U.S.- or European-based and have the dominant share of vaccine business on a revenue basis; but regional companies are gradually growing their market share on a dose basis (Table 4.1).1",3,Cost,Cost,0.7740841423202113
"In the past 20 years, the vaccine business, a former laggard",5,Vaccine,Vaccine – Business,1.0
"in the pharmaceutical business, has shown remarkable growth powered by new innovative vaccines coupled with superior pricing strategies (Fig. 4.1).2 Specifically contributing to this spectacular growth were the varicella, hepatitis A, pneumococ- cal conjugate, shingles, rotavirus, meningococcal conjugate for A, C, Y, W, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, as well as myriad combination vaccines.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Developed,0.9144521393558724
This projected growth may plateau in the early 2020s unless the vaccine industry continues to introduce new inno- vative products targeting diseases that impact the Western world. Sustaining this growth will be a challenge because of dwindling numbers of high-value vaccine targets for which the biology of protection is well understood (see Table 4.7).,6,Vaccine,Vaccine – Growth,0.7054084376720778
"The vaccine business is a capital-intensive business that requires considerable ongoing investment in manufacturing assets, facilities, and people to maintain compliance with ever- increasing regulatory directives. The recent departure of Baxter and Novartis from the vaccine industry is an ominous sign that reflects the continued financial pressure on the remaining four major vaccine makers.",7,Venture,Venture,1.0
"The United States has been extraordinarily successful in vaccine research and development (R&D).3,4 In the past 20 years, most new vaccines approved worldwide were developed in the United States. Approximately 15 new vaccines were approved in the United States between 1995 and 2014.5,6 Since then, combinations of existing vaccines have been introduced for simplified pediatric vaccination resulting in a wider adop- tion of acellular pertussis vaccination. A polyvalent pneumo- coccal conjugate vaccine for infants introduced by Wyeth (now a subsidiary of Pfizer) has been widely adopted and has made Pfizer a major force in the vaccine business. Since 2006, several new vaccines have been licensed, including a combination of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and varicella, as well as new vaccines against rotavirus, herpes zoster, HPV, meningo- coccus, influenza, and others. The HPV vaccines developed by Merck and GlaxoSmithKline significantly expanded the field of adolescent vaccines and confirmed market acceptance of premium pricing.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Developed,1.0
"In the last 10 years, the vaccine industry in the United States and Europe has considerably improved its reliability as a sup- plier. Chronic shortages are a thing of the past; this turn- around has primarily been achieved by modernization of vaccine manufacturing and distribution infrastructure sup- ported and funded by the profitability of the vaccine business. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stock- piling of pediatric vaccines has alleviated some concerns of critical shortages in case of supply interruptions. But the industry’s vulnerability because of dependence on single- sourced vaccines continues to be an unresolved concern. The regulators and the industry must proactively develop a solu- tion to this critical challenge and avoid any future public health crisis resulting from vaccine shortages during a pro- longed supply interruption.",10,Vaccine,Vaccine – Reliability,1.0
VACCINE DEVELOPMENT,0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0
"Vaccine development is difficult, complex, highly risky, and costly, and includes clinical development, process develop- ment, and assay development.

Vaccine development requires strong project management systems and controls and requisite skill sets among scientists and engineers. A key strategic document that guides the stake- holders in vaccine development is the “target product profile” (TPP).,0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0
"Process development involves making preparations of the test vaccine that satisfy regulatory requirements for clinical testing including clinical lots, preclinical toxicology testing, and analytical assessment, and finally, scale-up methods that lead to a consistent manufacturing process at one-tenth of full scale. Assay development involves the definition of specific methods to test the purity of raw materials, stability and potency of the vaccine product, and immunologic and other criteria to predict vaccine efficacy.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0
"Clinical development involves studies of the effects of vaccines on patients for safety, immu- nogenicity, and efficacy through a staged process: phase 1, early safety and immunogenicity in small numbers; phase 2, safety, dose ranging, and immunogenicity in 200 to 400 individuals; sometimes phase 2b, nonlicensure, proof-of-concept trials for efficacy; and phase 3, safety and efficacy trials that permit licen-",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0
"Bulk manufacturing includes cell culture and/or fermentation-based manufactur- ing followed by a variety of separation processes to purify the vaccine. The finishing operations include formulation with adjuvant/stabilizer followed by vial or syringe filling (includ- ing lyophilization in the case of live viral vaccines) followed by labeling, packaging, and controlled storage.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0
"critically important to the overall success of a vaccine develop- ment program. Postlicensure studies of safety and efficacy (phase 4) of vaccines are essential and represent a large additional cost. It is important to note that, unlike pharmaceuticals, vaccines that pass early proof-of-con- cept studies in humans have a very high probability of achiev- ing licensure.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0
"The first stage of vaccine development involves acceptance of a candidate from a basic research laboratory and develop- ment of a small-scale process and formulation to make mate- rial for Phase I study, analytical release assays, preclinical toxicology, immunological assays to evaluate clinical responses, an investigational new drug (IND) filing, and well-designed Phase I/IIa studies.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0

"In general, the analytical and release assays are particularly difficult to develop because, in most cases, vaccines are con- sidered “not well-characterized” biologicals by regulatory agencies.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0
"The final stage is Biologics License Application (BLA) prep- aration, licensure, and vaccine launch, which requires 1.5 to 2 years.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0
"With few exceptions, each vaccine requires a different plant because of unique manufacturing requirements and the regulatory difficulties associated with changing over to a dif- ferent product. Despite the complexity of bulk vaccine manufacturing, 3 to 5 years post–product launch, the fully burdened bulk cost of production for most of the older vaccines declines to as little as $0.50 to $1.00 per dose, and significant elements of product cost are primarily driven by activities related to filling, vialing, and packaging (Table 4.2). Established vaccines with a limited number of suppliers can generate very high profit margins over the product life cycle.",3,Cost,Cost,1.0
"Furthermore, it is far better to produce consistency lots in the final vaccine production factory to demonstrate the ability to manufacture the vaccine reliably and to use those lots in the Phase III efficacy trials.",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Animal,1.0
"Estimates of cost of development of a new drug or vaccine have risen from $231 million in 1991, to $802 million in 2003, to $1 billion in 2010.7–9",3,Cost,Cost,1.0
"First, the number of new vaccines brought to licensure annually by a company or the industry is very small compared with other products, and correlates with R&D expenditures of $600 million to $800 million for each new product. Thus, if a company spends $100 million annually for vaccine R&D, one might expect one new product every 6 to 8 years, and this appears to hold true. Second, biotechnology companies that are focused on one vaccine and have success- fully brought it to market have spent $500 million to $700 million on R&D as exemplified by the development of the live attenuated influenza vaccine by Aviron, now Medimmune. In summary, vaccine development from concept to licensure is a lengthy process as illustrated by timelines for some of the cur- rently licensed vaccines (Table 4.3).",3,Cost,Cost,1.0

"The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the major funding source via intramural and extramural (largely aca- demic) programs of fundamental research (e.g., gene-based vaccines or T-cell memory studies) and directed research on pathogens (e.g., HIV), which may lead to new vaccine candi- dates. The NIH, through its vaccine trials network, has increased its role in clinical development domestically and internationally. In addition, the Dale and Betty Bumpers Vaccine Research Center at the NIH was established in 1999 primarily to pursue the development of HIV vaccines.",2,Vaccines,Vaccines – Government,1.0
"The CDC conducts disease surveillance and epidemiological studies to ascertain the prev- alence and incidence of specific diseases; this information provides a rationale for prioritizing vaccine development. These studies by the CDC are performed in addition to studies conducted by the vaccine companies, such as Phase IV studies. Through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the CDC recommends usage of vaccines, and is responsible for most of the public purchases (directly through the Vaccines for Children program for approximately 41%, and indirectly through other federal, state, and local govern- ment purchases for approximately 16%, together totaling approximately 57% of all childhood vaccines in the United States), thereby playing a major role in determining the demand and potential profit associated with vaccines. Profes- sional organizations such as the American Academy of Pedi- atrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians also make recommendations for vaccine usage. There is no federal vaccine program for adults, although Medicare does reimburse for influenza and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. However, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires health plans to cover vaccines recommended by the ACIP prior to September 2009 with no copayments or other cost-sharing requirements when those services are delivered by an in-network provider.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"Funding sources for vaccine R&D include government, profits from sales of product, risk capital, and charitable foundations. Similarly, vaccine R&D sponsored through the DOD, FDA, CDC, and USAID is competitive with other public needs as determined by the executive and legislative branches of government. Recent funding for bioterrorism vaccines (anthrax, smallpox) and emerging pathogens (Ebola, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], pandemic influenza) could have long-reaching impact on vaccine research and manufac- turing and could potentially create new entrants into the vaccine business.",2,Vaccines,Vaccines – Government,1.0
