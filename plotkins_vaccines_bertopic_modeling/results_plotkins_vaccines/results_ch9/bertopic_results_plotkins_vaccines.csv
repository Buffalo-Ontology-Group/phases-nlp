"Recommendations for immunization practices are based on scientific knowledge of vaccine characteristics, biology of immunization, epidemiology of specific diseases, and host characteristics. In addition, experience and judgment of public health officials and specialists in clinical and preventive medi- cine play a key role in developing recommendations that maximize benefits and minimize risks and costs associated with immunization. General guidelines for immunization practices are based on evidence and expert opinion of benefits and risks of vaccinations as they apply to the current epidemi- ology of disease and use of vaccines in the United States. However, many of the principles are universal and are appli- cable to other countries where different public health infra- structures may exist.",21,Immunization,Immunization – Vaccinations,0.4317175442766197
VACCINE STORAGE AND HANDLING,0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Shipping,1.0
"Vaccines must be properly shipped, stored, and handled to avoid loss of their biologic activities. Recommended storage and handling requirements for each vaccine are given in each manufacturer’s product information.1 Correct shipping, storage, and handling practices also are published in recom- mendations of the major vaccine policymaking committees, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the World Health Organiza- tion (see Chapter 76).2–5 Failure to adhere to these require- ments can result in loss of vaccine potency, leading to an inadequate immune response in the vaccinee. Visible evidence of altered vaccine integrity may not be present. The state/local health department or the manufacturer should be contacted when questions arise about the correct handling of a vaccine. New vaccines or new formulations of an existing vaccine may have different shipping, storage, and handling requirements. The recommended storage practices for the most commonly used vaccines in the United States are described in the Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit.6",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Shipping,1.0
Refrigerators without freezers and standalone freezers are,24,Vaccine,Vaccine – Freezers,1.0
"usually most effective at maintaining the precise temperatures required for vaccine storage and are preferred to combination refrigerator/freezer units. Freezer storage units may be manual defrost or automatic defrost (“frost-free”). Automatic defrost freezers periodically and transiently increase the freezer tem- perature to reduce the formation of ice. This type of freezer unit is acceptable for storage of vaccines that must be stored in a frozen state (varicella, measles-mumps-rubella-varicella [MMRV], oral polio, zoster).",24,Vaccine,Vaccine – Freezers,0.959632450564096
"Exposure to higher or lower temperatures than recom- mended can damage a vaccine. For example, live virus vac- cines, such as oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), varicella, combination MMRV, and zoster vaccine, are sensitive to tem- peratures above freezing and should be kept frozen until just before administration. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR without varicella) vaccine may be stored at either refrigerator or freezer temperature. Rotavirus vaccine and yellow fever vaccine should be stored at refrigerator temperature (2–8°C).3,7 Some vac- cines composed of purified antigens or inactivated microor- ganisms, such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae",24,Vaccine,Vaccine – Freezers,0.6066257198091183

"type b (Hib), human papillomavirus (HPV), and inactivated influenza, can lose their potency if frozen and should be kept at refrigerator temperature and never frozen.3,4 Diluents should not be frozen and may be kept at room or refrigerator tem- perature. Maintenance of a “cold chain” from vaccine produc- tion to use helps ensure vaccine potency at the time of administration. Temperature monitoring and control are important for storage and handling of all vaccines, particularly during transport and field use. Temperatures should be moni- tored at least twice a day, using a thermometer that records current, maximum, and minimum temperatures. Whereas maintenance of cold and freezing temperatures may be a problem in tropical climates, data suggest that inappropriate freezing of inactivated vaccines is a problem in maintaining vaccine stability in cold and temperate climates. Shipping con- tainers should be sturdy, the correct size for the amount of vaccine to be shipped, and contain a temperature monitor. Appropriate insulation (e.g., panels and boxes of polystyrene, isocyanurate, or polyurethane) and cold source (e.g., bottles with frozen liquid) should be used to maintain the recom- mended temperature. Dry ice should not be used to transport frozen vaccine, because it might expose the vaccine to tem- peratures lower than recommended for storage. Loose fillers do not provide reliable temperature insulation.3",24,Vaccine,Vaccine – Freezers,1.0
Vaccines should not be reconstituted until immediately,24,Vaccine,Vaccine – Freezers,0.11775985141309911
"before use. If not administered within the interval recom- mended by the manufacturer, reconstituted vaccine should be discarded.5 Only the diluent provided by the manufacturer should be used to reconstitute a lyophilized vaccine.

Infection Control and Sterile Injection Technique,16,Syringes,Syringes,0.9639777425029656
"Infection resulting from administration of vaccines is unlikely if appropriate precautions are utilized. Hands should be washed with soap and water or cleansed with an alcohol- based waterless antiseptic hand rub before each patient contact to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination and transmission of microorganisms between vaccine recipients and healthcare personnel. In general, use of protective gloves is not necessary when administering vaccines unless the healthcare provider",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"will have contact with potentially infectious body fluids or has open lesions on the hands.2,5",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Failure to follow relevant infection control guidelines can result in transmission of bloodborne pathogens or bacterial infection and abscess formation. Contamination of an injec- tion site can occur from bacteria on the skin at the site of injection. To prevent such contamination, skin at the injection site should be prepared with isopropyl alcohol (70%) or another disinfecting agent and allowed to dry before injection. Transmission of pathogens also can occur if needles, syringes, vaccines, or other equipment used to administer vaccines becomes contaminated. To prevent such contamination, syringes and needles must be sterile. A separate needle and syringe should be used for each injection. Disposable needles and syringes should be discarded after a single use in a labeled, puncture-proof container to prevent inadvertent needle-stick injury or reuse. Because recapping and removing a used needle from a syringe can result in injury to the user, needles should not be recapped after use.5 The needle and syringe should be discarded as a single unit without removing the needle from the syringe. Single-use disposable needles and syringes should not be sterilized and reused.",16,Syringes,Syringes,1.0
"If only reusable (i.e., nondisposable) needles and syringes",16,Syringes,Syringes,1.0
"are available, they must be thoroughly cleaned and sterilized after each injection to prevent transmission of bloodborne or other pathogens between patients. Reusable syringes are usually glass rather than plastic. Because of its inert character- istics, glass can be cleaned and sterilized more easily than plastic. Because hypodermic needles enter deep tissues, great care must be taken to ensure that all contaminants are removed from the needle and syringe.8 Liquid germicides alone are insufficient for needle sterilization because of the restricted access of the chemical agent to the lumen of the needle. Strict adherence to the recommended time and temperature for the sterilization procedure used must be observed.",16,Syringes,Syringes,0.9022089554314889
"Most vaccines have a similar appearance after they are drawn into a syringe. Cases in which the wrong vaccine was administered often are attributable to the practice of prefilling syringes or drawing doses of a vaccine into multiple syringes before their immediate need.5 The routine practice of prefill- ing syringes should be discouraged because of the potential for such administration errors. To prevent errors, vaccine doses should not be drawn into a syringe until immediately before administration. In certain circumstances in which a single vaccine type is used (e.g., in a community influenza vaccina- tion campaign), filling a small number (10 or fewer) of syringes before their immediate use may be considered. Care should be taken to ensure that the cold chain and sterility are maintained until the vaccine is administered. When the syringes are filled, the type of vaccine, lot number, and date of filling must be labeled accurately on each syringe, and the doses should be administered as soon as possible after filling, by the same person who filled the syringes. Manufacturer prefilled-syringes that are activated (i.e., syringe cap removed or needle attached) but unused should be discarded at the end of the clinic day. Likewise, vaccine drawn into syringes by the user (i.e., not by the manufacturer) should be discarded at the end of the clinic day.",16,Syringes,Syringes,1.0
Route of Administration,-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"One or more routes of administration (e.g., intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intranasal, and oral) are recom- mended for each vaccine and are listed in the manufacturer’s product label and in published recommendations of immu- nization advisory committees (Table 9.1).2,5 These routes usually are determined during prelicensure vaccine studies and are based on vaccine composition and immunogenicity.",88,Vaccine,Vaccine – Administered,1.0
"Vaccines should be administered in sites where they elicit the desired immune response and where the likelihood of local tissue, neural, or vascular injury is minimal.2 To avoid unnec- essary local and systemic adverse events and to ensure the appropriate immune response, people administering vaccines should not deviate from the recommended route of adminis- tration in the product label. A route of administration or anatomic site of injection different from that recommended can result in an inadequate immune response. For example, the immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccine and rabies vaccine is substantially lower when the gluteal instead of the deltoid vaccination site is used.9,10 The reduced immunogenicity pre- sumably is a result of inadvertent injection into subcutaneous or deep fatty tissue rather than into muscle.",88,Vaccine,Vaccine – Administered,1.0
"Deep intramuscular injection generally is recommended for adjuvant-containing vaccines because subcutaneous or intradermal administration can cause marked local irritation, induration, skin discoloration, inflammation, and granuloma formation.5 However, subcutaneous injection can lessen the risk of local neurovascular injury and is recommended for vaccines that are less reactogenic but immunogenic when administered by this route, such as live virus vaccines. Intra- dermal administration is preferred for live bacille Calmette- Guérin (BCG) vaccine and one brand of inactivated influenza vaccine.11",88,Vaccine,Vaccine – Administered,1.0
"Aspiration before injection of vaccines or toxoids (i.e., pulling back on the syringe plunger after needle insertion, before injection) is not necessary because there are no large blood vessels at the recommended injection sites. Also, the process of aspiration can be painful, especially for infants.12",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
Subcutaneous Injections,69,Injections,Injections – Intramus,1.0
"Vaccines recommended for subcutaneous injection usually are administered into the thigh of infants younger than 12 months of age and into the upper, outer triceps area of persons 12 months of age or older. Subcutaneous injections also can be administered into the upper, outer triceps area of an infant. A 58 -inch, 23- to 25-gauge needle is recommended in most situations.2,5 The needle is inserted into the tissues below the dermal layer of the skin. To avoid administering the vaccine into a muscle, the skin and subcutaneous tissue should be held gently between the thumb and fingers to raise these tissues from the muscle layer. The needle is inserted into the resulting skinfold at an approximately 45-degree angle.5",57,Injections,Injections – Vaccines,0.9510813051651384
Intramuscular Injections,69,Injections,Injections – Intramus,1.0
"Selection of the site of injection and needle size is based on the volume of vaccine to be administered, the thickness of the overlying subcutaneous tissue, the size of the muscle, and the desired depth below the muscle surface into which the mate- rial is to be injected.",57,Injections,Injections – Vaccines,1.0
"The quadriceps muscle mass in the anterolateral thigh is most commonly used for intramuscular injection in infants, whereas the deltoid muscle of the upper arm is the usual recommended site for older children and adults. After a child begins to walk, the upper arm is the preferred site.13 By this age, the child’s deltoid muscle is usually large enough to be used for intramuscular injection. Although the anterolateral thigh is also an acceptable site, intramuscular injection into the thighs of 18-month-old children has been reported to cause transient limping.14,15 For infants and younger children, if more than two vaccines are injected in a single limb, the thigh is the preferred site because of the greater muscle mass; the injections should be sufficiently separated (i.e., ≥1 inch) so that any local reactions can be differentiated.13,14",61,Intramuscular,Intramuscular,0.8777078324103418
"Because of the potential risk of injury to the sciatic nerve, the gluteal region is not recommended for routine vaccina- tion.2,5 This recommendation is based primarily on reported cases of sciatic nerve injury resulting from injection of antimi- crobial agents or antiserum into the gluteus.16,17 No reports of direct nerve injury resulting from gluteal injection of current childhood vaccines have been published.",96,Sciatic,Sciatic,1.0
"If injections are given in the gluteal site, care must be taken to avoid nerve injury. The central region of the buttocks should be avoided. The needle should be inserted into the upper, outer quadrant and directed anteriorly (i.e., not cau- dally or perpendicular to the skin surface). If the gluteal muscle is chosen, injection should be lateral and superior to a line between the posterior superior iliac spine and the greater trochanter or the ventrogluteal site (i.e., the center of the triangle bounded by the anterior superior iliac spine, the tubercle of the iliac crest, and the upper border of the greater trochanter of the femur). These areas are free of major neurovascular structures. Because of the large volume that must be injected and its large muscle mass, the gluteal site",96,Sciatic,Sciatic,1.0

"A 22- to 25-gauge needle is appropriate for intramuscular administration of most vaccines. The ideal needle length may depend on the vaccination technique.18 One technique for intramuscular injections consists of gently bunching the muscle in the free hand while the needle is inserted perpen- dicular to the skin.

"Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is licensed for healthy nonpregnant persons 2 through 49 years of age and is the only vaccine administered by the intranasal route. The administra- tion device is a nasal sprayer with a dose-divider clip that allows introduction of one 0.1-mL spray into each naris. The tip should be inserted slightly into the naris before administra- tion. Even if the person coughs or sneezes immediately after administration or the dose is expelled any other way, the vaccine dose need not be repeated. Introduction of low levels of vaccine viruses into the environment likely is unavoidable when administering LAIV; however, no cases have been reported of illness or attenuated vaccine virus infections among inadvertently exposed healthcare providers or immu- nocompromised patients. The risk for acquiring vaccine viruses from the environment is unknown but is likely low; in addition, vaccine viruses are cold-adapted and attenuated and unlikely to cause symptomatic influenza. Severely immuno- suppressed persons should not administer LAIV. However, other persons at higher risk for influenza complications can administer LAIV. These include persons with underlying medical conditions placing them at higher risk or who are likely to be at risk, including pregnant women, persons with asthma, and persons 50 years or older.28",64,Doses,Doses – Laiv,1.0

"Bloodborne diseases (e.g., hepatitides B and C and HIV) are occupational hazards for healthcare providers. In November 2000, to reduce the incidence of needlestick injuries among healthcare providers and the consequent risk for bloodborne diseases acquired from patients, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act was signed into law in the United States. The act directed the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Admin- istration (OSHA) to strengthen its existing bloodborne patho- gen standards. Those standards were revised and became effective in April 2001.29 These federal regulations require the use of engineering and work practice controls to eliminate or minimize employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens.30 “Engineering controls” mean controls (e.g., sharps disposal containers; self-sheathing needles; and safer medical devices, such as sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems) that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace.31 Work practice con- trols mean procedures followed by employers and workers to control hazards in the workplace (e.g., good housekeeping practices; closed transfers/containers/processes; and hygiene procedures).",4,Needlestick,Needlestick,1.0

AGES FOR ADMINISTRATION OF IMMUNOBIOLOGICS,19,Immunization,Immunization – Poliovirus,0.849601196488739
"Recommendations for the age and timing of vaccination are based on multiple considerations and may vary in different countries. Optimal response to a vaccine depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the vaccine and the age and immune status of the recipient. Recommendations for the age at which vaccines are administered are influenced by age- specific risks for disease and complications, ability of persons of a certain age to respond to the vaccine, and potential inter- ference with the immune response by passively transferred maternal antibody or previously administered antibody- containing blood products. Vaccines usually are recommended for members of the youngest age group at risk for experiencing the disease for whom efficacy and safety have been demon- strated. These principles are demonstrated with the following examples.",7,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination – T7,0.5460341605426968
"The optimal timing for administration of measles vaccine depends on the rate of disappearance of passively acquired maternal antibody and the risk of exposure to measles virus. At birth and through the first 6 months of life, most infants have passive immunity to measles because of transplacentally acquired maternal measles antibodies. These antibodies inter- fere with the immune response to live virus measles vaccine by limiting vaccine virus replication. In many developing countries, where measles is highly endemic and frequently affects infants, routine measles vaccination is recommended at 9 months of age (see Chapter 21).52 However, in the United States, where measles is less common and measles among infants is infrequent, measles vaccine is recommended rou- tinely at 12 through 15 months of age, ages at which almost all infants will have no residual maternal antibody.2,53",55,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunity,1.0
Another example is the recommended age of pertussis vac-,35,Vaccine,Vaccine – Pertussis,1.0
"cination. Early infancy is the time of greatest risk of serious complications from pertussis, but infants who are younger than 1 month of age do not respond as well immunologically to whole-cell pertussis vaccine (and presumably acellular vac- cines) as do older infants.54–56 Initiation of routine immuniza- tion with pertussis vaccine in the United States is recommended at 2 months of age.57,58 This scheduling represents a compro- mise between factors affecting the immune response and the epidemiology of the disease necessitating early protection against pertussis. Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) given to pregnant women will stimulate the development of maternal antipertussis antibodies, which will be transferred to the fetus by the placenta, likely providing the newborn with protection against pertussis in early life.59 Tdap also will protect the mother from pertussis around the time of delivery, making her less likely to become infected and transmit pertussis to her infant.59 Vaccination too early in life also may affect the immune response to subsequent doses of vaccine. For example, neonatal administration of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DT) may result in suppression of antibody responses to subsequent doses of Hib conjugate vaccines covalently linked to forms of those toxoids.60 When children who receive measles vaccine before the age of 1 year are revaccinated, they develop vaccine- induced immunity against disease but may have a somewhat diminished antibody response compared with children vacci- nated initially after their first birthday.61,62",63,Tdap,Tdap,1.0

"The possibility that two doses of the same or different live virus vaccines administered within too short an interval may inhibit the immunologic response to the second dose is based on evidence from animal and human studies. Petralli and colleagues68,69 reported that the immune response to smallpox vaccination was affected by prior administration of live attenu- ated measles vaccine. Interferon produced in response to the initial dose of measles virus vaccine has been postulated to inhibit replication of vaccinia virus in the subsequent vaccine dose. In a study in two U.S. health maintenance organizations, persons who received varicella vaccine less than 30 days after MMR vaccination had an increased risk of varicella vaccine failure (i.e., varicella disease in a vaccinated person) of 2.5- fold compared with persons who received varicella vaccine before or 30 days or more after MMR.70 In contrast, Stefano and colleagues71 determined that the response to yellow fever vaccine is not affected by monovalent measles vaccine admin- istered 1 to 27 days earlier. In general, live virus vaccines administered orally do not interfere with live virus vaccines administered parenterally or orally, although a reduction in the seroconversion rate following the first dose of monovalent rotavirus vaccine has been reported when this dose is admin- istered concurrently with OPV.72 The effect of nasally admin- istered vaccine on the response to other live vaccines not administered at the same visit is not known.",1,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination,0.2882736507746229

"Simultaneous administration of all indicated vaccines is an essential component of childhood vaccination programs.2,5 Simultaneous administration of different vaccines is particu- larly important when return of the recipient for further vaccination is uncertain, imminent exposure to several vaccine- preventable diseases is expected, or a vaccinee is preparing for international travel on short notice.

"Unless specifically licensed for injection in the same syringe, different vaccines administered simultaneously should be injected separately and at different anatomic sites. If both upper and lower limbs must be used for simultaneous admin- istration of different vaccines, the anterolateral thigh is often chosen for intramuscular injections and the triceps region for subcutaneous injections. If more than one injection must be administered in a single limb of an infant or young child, the thigh usually is preferred because of its large muscle mass.

"Increased severity or incidence of adverse reactions has not been observed after simultaneous administration of the most widely used vaccines.5 Similarly, simultaneous administration of vaccines generally does not cause immunologic interfer- ence, with two exceptions. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and Menactra brand meningococcal conjugate vaccine should not be administered simultaneously in children with func- tional or anatomic asplenia, because Menactra interferes with the immune response to the seven-valent pneumococcal con- jugate vaccine (and presumably PCV13 as well). Children with functional or anatomic asplenia are at high risk for pneumo- coccal infection. All doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should be administered first and then a dose of Menactra should be administered 4 weeks after the last dose of pneu- mococcal conjugate vaccine. Interference is not known to occur with other brands of meningococcal conjugate vaccine and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Pneumococcal polysac- charide vaccine may interfere with the immune response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. If both doses are indicated, they should not be administered simultaneously. For persons with immunosuppressive high-risk conditions indicated for both PCV13 and PPSV23, PCV13 should be administered first, with PPSV23 administered 8 weeks later. For persons with immunocompetent high-risk conditions for invasive pneumo- coccal disease or for healthy persons aged 65 years or older indicated for both PCV13 and PPSV23, PCV13 should be administered first, with PPSV23 administered 1 year later.

INTERFERENCE BY IMMUNOGLOBULINS,97,Immunoglobulin,Immunoglobulin,1.0
"Passively acquired antibodies can interfere with the immune response to certain vaccines, both live and inactivated, and to toxoids. The result can be the absence of seroconversion or a blunting of the immune response with lower final antibody concentrations in the vaccinee.

Interference With Live Virus Vaccines,1,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination,0.34395890997799156
"To elicit an adequate immune response, live vaccine virus must replicate in the recipient. The probable mechanism by which passively acquired immunoglobulin blunts the immune response is neutralization of vaccine virus, resulting in inhibi- tion of viral replication and insufficient antigenic mass.79 For example, persisting transplacentally acquired maternal measles antibodies inhibit the response to live measles vaccine in infants for as long as 12 months and perhaps longer.80,81 The age to which inhibition persists has been correlated with con- centrations of maternal or cord blood antibodies.82–84 Rubella vaccine virus may be less susceptible than measles vaccine virus to these transplacentally acquired maternal antibod- ies.83,85 The effect of blood and immunoglobulin preparations on the response to mumps and varicella vaccines is unknown, but commercial immunoglobulin preparations contain anti- bodies to these viruses.

Although of theoretical concern, no cases of congenital rubella or varicella syndrome or abnormalities attributable to fetal infection have been observed among infants born to suscep- tible women who received rubella or varicella vaccines during pregnancy.53,208 Because of the importance of protecting women of childbearing age against rubella and varicella, rea- sonable practices in any vaccination program include asking women if they are pregnant or might become pregnant in the next 4 weeks, not vaccinating women who state that they are pregnant, explaining the theoretical risk for the fetus if MMR or varicella vaccine were administered to a women who is pregnant, and counseling women who are vaccinated not to become pregnant during the 4 weeks after MMR or varicella vaccination.53,208,209",23,Vaccination,Vaccination – Vaccines,0.5589284673944477

"The ability of a clinician to determine that a person is pro- tected on the basis of country of origin and the person’s records alone is limited. Vaccines administered outside the United States generally can be accepted as valid if the schedule was similar to that recommended in the United States (i.e., minimum ages and intervals; see Table 9.2). Only written documentation should be accepted as evidence of previous vaccination. Written records are more likely to predict protec- tion if the vaccines, dates of administration, intervals between doses, and the person’s age at the time of vaccination are comparable to U.S. recommendations.5 Although vaccines with inadequate potency have been produced in other coun- tries,213,214 most vaccines used worldwide are produced with adequate quality control standards and are potent.",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Shipping,1.0
"The number of American families adopting children from outside the United States has increased substantially in recent years.215 Adopted children’s birth countries often have immu- nization schedules that differ from the recommended child- hood immunization schedule in the United States. Differences between schedules used in other countries include the vac- cines administered, the recommended ages of administration, and the number and timing of doses (see Chapters 74 to 76). The ACIP has published guidelines for assessing and vaccinat- ing international adoptees.5 Children adopted in the United States from other countries should receive vaccines according to U.S.-recommended schedules.",33,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adoptees,0.5023706511313306
"Data are inconclusive regarding the extent to which an internationally adopted child’s immunization record reflects the child’s protection. A child’s record might indicate admin- istration of MMR vaccine when only single-antigen measles vaccine was administered. A study of children adopted from the People’s Republic of China, Russia, and Eastern Europe determined that only 39% (range: 17%–88% by country) of children with documentation of more than three doses of DTP before adoption had protective serologic concentrations of diphtheria and tetanus antitoxin.216 This finding raised ques- tions about whether the vaccines received were potent or whether the immunization records purporting to show receipt of at least three doses were an accurate reflection of the true number of doses actually received. However, antibody testing was performed by a hemagglutination assay, which may underestimate protection and cannot directly be compared with antitoxin concentration measured by other tests.217 A second study measured antibody to diphtheria and tetanus toxins among 51 children who had records of having received two or more doses of DTP. Most of the children were from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Asian countries, and 78% had received all vaccine doses in an orphanage; 94% had evidence of protection against diphtheria (enzyme immunoassay [EIA]",33,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adoptees,1.0

Additional studies using standardized methods are needed.",33,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adoptees,0.9005662600029428
"If a question exists regarding whether vaccines adminis- tered outside the United States were immunogenic, several approaches may be considered. Repeating the vaccinations as age-appropriate is an acceptable option; this usually is safe and avoids the need to obtain and interpret serologic tests.5 If avoiding unnecessary injections is desired, judicious use of serologic testing can help determine which immunizations are needed, particularly for DTP/DTaP vaccine. Although no established serologic correlates exist for protection against per- tussis, diphtheria and tetanus antitoxin levels may be used as surrogates to assess whether doses listed on the immunization record actually were received or were potent.5",33,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adoptees,1.0
"Increased rates of moderate to severe local adverse reac- tions after the fourth and fifth doses of DTP or DTaP have been reported.108 If a revaccination option is adopted and a severe local reaction occurs, serologic testing for specific immuno- globulin G antibody to tetanus and diphtheria toxins can be performed before administering additional doses. Protective concentrations indicate that further doses are unnecessary, and subsequent vaccination should occur as age-appropriate. Instead of revaccinating a child with DTaP when there is a question about the validity of a record that indicates receipt of three or more doses of DTP or DTaP, serologic testing for specific immunoglobulin G antibody to diphtheria and tetanus toxin can be obtained. If a protective concentration is present, recorded doses can be considered valid, and the vaccination series should be completed as age-appropriate. Indeterminate antibody concentration might indicate immunologic memory but waning antibody.

"risk for seizures after receipt of whole-cell pertussis, MMR (or monovalent measles) vaccine, or MMRV vaccine.53,219–221 In most cases, these seizures are brief, self-limited, and associated with fever. Studies have not established a causal association between these seizures and residual seizure disorders or per- manent neurologic sequelae.222,223 Acellular pertussis vaccines are associated less often with fever than are whole-cell pertus- sis vaccines; whole-cell DTP is no longer available in the United States.",95,Vaccines,Vaccines – Seizures,1.0
"Because neurologic disorders such as epilepsy and degen- erative disorders marked by loss of developmental milestones often become manifest during infancy, pertussis vaccination may coincide with onset or recognition of such disorders and cause confusion about the etiologic role of the vaccine. For infants with a personal history of a seizure, delaying pertussis vaccination is recommended until a progressive neurologic disorder is excluded or the cause of the seizure has been estab- lished.57,58 Because measles vaccine is administered at an age when a child’s neurologic status is likely to already have been established, deferring measles immunization of a child with a personal history of a seizure is not recommended.53,184",95,Vaccines,Vaccines – Seizures,1.0
"Pertussis and measles vaccinations are not contraindicated in persons with a family history of seizures. Even though children with a parent or sibling who has had a seizure are themselves at increased risk for a seizure, the benefits of administering pertussis and measles vaccine to children with a family history of seizures substantially outweigh the small risks because the seizures are usually febrile in origin, gener- ally have a benign outcome, and are not likely to be confused with manifestations of a previously unrecognized neurologic disorder.53,58,184,222,224 In June 2009, after consideration of the postlicensure data and other evidence, ACIP adopted recom- mendations regarding use of MMRV vaccine for the first and second doses and identified a personal or family (i.e., sibling or parent) history of seizure as a precaution for use of MMRV vaccine. For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at age 12 to 47 months, either MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine or MMRV vaccine may be used. Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination options with the parents or caregivers. Unless the parent or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC recommends that MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine should be adminis- tered for the first dose in this age group. For the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines at any age (15 months to 12 years) and for the first dose at age 48 months or older, use of MMRV vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine). This recommenda- tion is consistent with ACIP’s 2009 provisional general recom- mendations regarding use of combination vaccines which state that use of a combination vaccine generally is preferred over its equivalent component vaccines.5",95,Vaccines,Vaccines – Seizures,1.0
VACCINATION DURING ACUTE ILLNESS,2,Vaccination,Vaccination – Vaccine,0.466690086060701
"The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of an intercurrent or recent acute illness depends on evaluation of the etiology of the disease and the severity of symptoms.2,5 Mild illness, febrile (temperature ≥38°C) or afebrile, is not a contraindication to vaccination. Although one study reported a lower rate of seroconversion to the measles but not to the rubella or mumps components of MMR vaccine in children with evidence of a recent or current upper respiratory tract infection compared with children without this history,223 a difference in seroconversion to measles vaccine in healthy children compared with children who are ill has not been found in other studies.81,225–228",11,Vaccine,Vaccine – Vaccination – T11,1.0
"Acute minor illnesses, such as upper respiratory tract infec- tion, diarrhea, and acute otitis media, are common during infancy and childhood.229 Postponing vaccination in children with minor febrile or afebrile illness constitutes a missed opportunity to protect a child from disease, can contribute to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease, and can significantly impede efforts to immunize infants and young children on schedule.230–233 Every opportunity should be used to provide indicated vaccines and to avoid missed opportunities in persons who may not return for medical care and administra- tion of recommended vaccines.2,5,234,235 The potential benefit of preventing disease by timely vaccination far outweighs any small possible risk of vaccine failure.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Vaccination usually is deferred in persons who have moder- ate or severe illness. A person with signs or symptoms of moderate or severe illness at the scheduled time of vaccination should be requested to return as soon as the illness improves so that vaccines can be administered at the recommended ages. Waiting until after a person has recovered from the acute phase of a moderate or severe illness avoids superimposing a reaction to vaccination on the underlying illness or mistakenly attribut- ing a manifestation of the underlying illness to the vaccine.2,5",24,Vaccine,Vaccine – Freezers,0.08920201635332284
CONTRAINDICATIONS TO AND PRECAUTIONS REGARDING VACCINATION,0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Shipping,1.0
Vaccine contraindications and precautions are described in the manufacturer’s product labeling and in the recommendations for the use of vaccines developed by national advisory,0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Shipping,1.0
"committees such as the ACIP and the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the AAP. In the United States, the content of the product label is regulated by the Food and Drug Administra- tion on the basis of specific studies required of the manufac- turer to prove the safety and efficacy of a specific product. Most recommendations of vaccine advisory committees are the same as those in the product label. However, differences some- times exist because of advisory committees’ assessments of the risks and benefits of a given recommendation, their goal to make immunization as practical as possible, and their respon- sibility to develop recommendations for the use of vaccines in circumstances in which specific safety and efficacy data may be limited but for which physicians, nurses, and public health officials need guidance. For example, the manufacturer’s product label recommends that women vaccinated with live varicella virus vaccine avoid becoming pregnant for 3 months, whereas the ACIP and AAP advise waiting only 1 month.1,185,236 Similarly, the AAP and ACIP advise that pregnancy should not be considered a contraindication to hepatitis B vaccination, whereas the manufacturer’s product label states that hepatitis B vaccine should only be given to pregnant women if clearly indicated.1,201,237,238",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Shipping,1.0
