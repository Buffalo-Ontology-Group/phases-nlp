"In addition to one or more immunogens,* a vaccine may contain any of several added substances such as an adjuvant or a preservative. Residual components from the manufactur- ing process, in varying amounts, are also present in the vaccine. This chapter addresses the types and amounts of additives that are present in vaccines, the rationale for their inclusion, and the applicable federal regulations. Additionally, residual mate- rials from the manufacturing process that are present in the final formulation of the vaccine, as well as relevant federal regulations regarding these residuals, are discussed. Finally, albeit to a limited extent, several issues and concerns that cur- rently pertain to the use of, or presence of, some of these additives and residuals are examined.",3,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunogens,1.0
"This chapter focuses on vaccines licensed in the United States; vaccines licensed outside the United States may contain the same types of additives and residuals, although the amounts that are present in any given vaccine may differ. For the pur- poses of this chapter, the term “additives” refers to materials that are added to the immunogen by the manufacturer for a specific purpose. Additives include adjuvants, preservatives (i.e., antimicrobial agents), and stabilizers, as well as materials that are added to affect pH and isotonicity. In addition to addi- tives, vaccines contain residuals that remain from the licensed manufacturing process. The final formulation—immunogen plus additives and residuals—defines the specific vaccine; although not all manufacturing residuals can be identified and quantified, their presence and quantity is assumed to be con- stant because of the constancy of the manufacturing process. Some information regarding additives and residuals is consid- ered to be a trade secret and thus confidential, and cannot be discussed in this chapter.",3,Vaccines,Vaccines – Immunogens,0.917927735957905

Preservatives,22,Preservatives,Preservatives – Toxic,1.0
"Preservatives are added to vaccine formulations to prevent the growth of bacteria or fungi that may inadvertently be intro- duced into the vaccine during use. In some cases, preservatives are used during the manufacturing process (e.g., in buffers and column washes) to prevent microbial growth. Improvements in manufacturing technology, however, have decreased this need for the addition of preservatives to control bioburden during the manufacturing process. The Code of Federal Regu- lations (CFR) requires that, with certain defined exceptions, or with the approval of the Center Director (discussed later), preservatives must be added to multidose vials of vaccines. In the past, tragic consequences followed the use of multidose vials that did not contain a preservative, and served, in part, as the impetus for this requirement (see Wilson1 for a discus- sion of incidents related to the lack of preservatives in vaccines). Specifically, 21 CFR §610.15(a) states; “Products in multiple-dose containers shall contain a preservative, except that a preservative need not be added to Yellow Fever Vaccine; Polio-virus Vaccine Live Oral; viral vaccines labeled for use with the jet injector; dried vaccines when the accompanying diluent contains a preservative; or to an Allergenic Product in 50 percent or more volume in volume (v/v) glycerin.”",19,Preservative,Preservative,0.5743254158682698

"The CFR does not, however, provide a definition of a pre- servative. The definition (i.e., antimicrobial effectiveness) that has been used by the FDA for vaccines and other biologicals is found in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP).2 This is a func- tional definition, wherein the final formulation of the vaccine, including the preservative, is challenged with specified quanti- ties of the following organisms: Candida albicans, Aspergillus brasiliensis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudo- monas aeruginosa.

"Preservatives cannot completely eliminate the risk of bacte- rial or fungal contamination of vaccines; moreover, they do not address any potential viral contamination. Although it occurs rarely, and not in the recent past, the scientific litera- ture does contain reports3,4 (see also Wilson1) of bacterial contamination of vaccines despite the presence of a preserva- tive, emphasizing the need for meticulous attention to tech- nique when withdrawing vaccines from multiuse vials. At present, the following preservatives are used in U.S.-licensed vaccines: phenol, benzethonium chloride plus formaldehyde, 2-phenoxyethanol, and thimerosal (termed thiomersal in some other countries). Recently, the FDA amended the biologics regulations to permit exceptions or alternatives to the regula- tion for constituent materials (21 CFR §610.15), which includes preservatives and adjuvants. The following section was added to the regulation: “(d) The Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) or the Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) may approve an exception or alternative to any requirement in this Section. Requests for such exceptions must be in writing.”",19,Preservative,Preservative,1.0
"The amended regulation could, as an example, allow the",12,Vaccine,Vaccine – Antibiotics,1.0
"use of particular vial adaptors to prevent contamination of products in multidose vials without the use of preservatives. As noted in the final rule,5 the Director of CBER or the Director of CDER “would not approve an exception or alternative when the data or conditions of use, including the indication and patient population, do not provide a sufficient scientific and regulatory basis for such an approval.” The amended regula- tion took effect in May 2011.",24,Agents,Agents,1.0
"As noted, a preservative “shall not denature the specific substances in the product to result in a decrease below the minimum acceptable potency within the dating period when stored at the recommended temperature.” Certain preserva- tives are not compatible with certain antigens; compatibility must be established. For example, it has been known for a number of years that thimerosal has a deleterious effect on the potency of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV).6,7 An alterna- tive preservative is necessary for IPV. A preservative that is used in other products, 2-phenoxyethanol,8 has been found to be compatible with IPV vaccine formulations; it is used as a pre- servative in both of the currently U.S.-licensed IPV vaccines (IPOL [Sanofi Pasteur SA] and Poliovax [Sanofi Pasteur Ltd.; not currently marketed in the United States]).",19,Preservative,Preservative,0.694185599704515

"In recent years, considerable controversy has surrounded the use of thimerosal, an organomercurial, in vaccines. Although allergic responses to thimerosal have been described,13 a controversy, arising in the late 1990s, centered on the hypothesis that exposure to thimerosal, a derivative of ethyl mercury, may be causally linked to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Although there were no clear or definitive data to support a link between thimerosal and neurodevelopmental disorders, the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), first in July 199914 and again in June 2000,15 in an effort to reduce mercury exposure in children from all sources, recommended that thimerosal be removed from pediatric vaccines as expeditiously as possible. The July 1999 PHS statement was issued jointly with the American Academy of Pediatrics; the June 2000 PHS statement was issued jointly with the American Academy of Pediatricians, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Letters from CBER of the FDA, in 199916 and again in 2000,17 to the various vaccine manufacturers noted that the removal of thimerosal from vaccines was merited and requested manufacturers’ time- lines for thimerosal removal or submission of an explanation as to why thimerosal removal was not currently feasible.",5,Thimerosal,Thimerosal,0.601557587915946

"Safety Review Committee of the National Academy of Sci- ence’s IOM issued its final report, examining the hypothesis that, inter alia, thimerosal-containing vaccines are causally associated with autism. The committee concluded that the body of evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, and that the hypotheses that were generated concerning a biological mechanism for such causality were theoretical only.18 The European Medicines Agency also noted, as a precautionary measure, “that, although there is no evidence of harm caused by the level of exposure from vaccines, it would be prudent to promote the general use of vaccines without thiomersal and other mercury-containing preservatives.”19 Of note, the WHO continues to recommend the use of vaccines containing thimerosal because the need for multidose preservative- containing vaccines and, thus, the benefit of using such vac- cines outweighs the theoretical risk of toxicity.20 Additionally, the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has stated that it remains of the view that there is no evidence supporting a causal association between neurobehavioral disorders and thimerosal-containing vaccines.21 A more comprehensive update on the thimerosal-autism hypothesis for vaccines may be found in Chapter 82.",5,Thimerosal,Thimerosal,0.3358004758983211

"Adjuvants are materials that enhance and direct the immune response (see Chapter 6). Vaccine adjuvants are not licensed separately; rather, the adjuvant is a constituent of the licensed vaccine, and it is the vaccine formulation, in toto, that is tested in clinical trials and is licensed. An adjuvant cannot be added or removed, or its amount in a licensed vaccine changed, without submitting a supplement to the vaccine license and obtaining approval from the FDA. The various aluminum salts (aluminum hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, alum [potassium aluminum sulfate], or mixed aluminum salts) are the most commonly used adjuvants in U.S.-licensed vaccines. One vaccine, Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologi- cals), which contains AS04, an adjuvant system composed of an aluminum salt and monophosphoryl lipid A, a detoxified lipopolysaccharide (LPS), has been licensed. In 2013, as part of the U.S. government’s national pandemic preparedness ini- tiative, an H5N1 monovalent influenza vaccine, approved for use in persons 18 years of age and older, containing the unique adjuvant, AS03, manufactured by ID Biomedical Cor- poration of Quebec was licensed.

"50 years, surprisingly little has been known about their mecha- nism of action as adjuvants (see, e.g., Chapter 6 and Hogen- Esch22). For many years, the prevailing thought was that the aluminum salts functioned as depots for the vaccine immu- nogens. More recently, it was shown that the aluminum salts also activate inflammasomes, clusters of proteins found inside certain cells. Inflammasomes respond to stresses such as infec- tion or injury by releasing cytokines, which, in turn, stimulate an immune response.23",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Adjuvants,0.6146137217978856
"Table 7.1 presents the specific aluminum salt (hydroxide, phosphate, sulfate, or mixed) and the quantity of aluminum that is contained in a number of commonly used vaccines. (The aluminum content that is listed for some vaccines noted in Table 7.1 represents the upper limit of the specification; the vaccine may routinely contain less aluminum.) By regulation (21 CFR §610.15[a]), the aluminum content of a vaccine cannot exceed 0.85 mg of aluminum per dose if the amount is assayed, or 1.14 mg/dose if determined by calculation based on the amount of the aluminum compound that is added. To harmonize with WHO recommendations, this regulation was amended in 1981 to permit up to 1.25 mg of aluminum per dose. However, the higher amount was permitted only “pro- vided that data demonstrating that the amount of aluminum used is safe and necessary to produce the intended effect are submitted to and approved by the Director, Center for Biolog- ics Evaluation and Research” (21 CFR §610.15[a]). The Euro- pean Pharmacopoeia likewise restricts the aluminum content to 1.25 mg per dose. It should be noted that the above",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Adjuvants,0.84416349470928

"Concerns have been raised in recent years about the use of aluminum in vaccines and potential adverse outcomes that may be associated with its use at the levels that exist in indi- vidual vaccines and through the additive effects of multiple vaccinations. These concerns about the use of aluminum in vaccines prompted a workshop that was sponsored by the National Vaccine Program Office in May 2000. The general use of aluminum salts in vaccines24 and aluminum toxicokinet- ics25 were reviewed during the workshop. In their overall summary of the workshop, Eickhoff and Meyers26 noted that “based on 70 years of experience, the use of salts of aluminum as adjuvants in vaccines has proven safe and effective.” A more recent study by FDA scientists, using updated parameters for toxicokinetic assessments, including current recommended vaccines and aluminum excretion data, concluded that the risk from aluminum exposure from vaccines and the environment to infants was extremely low.27",0,Vaccine,Vaccine – Adjuvants,1.0
Stabilizers,14,Buffers,Buffers,1.0
"Various stabilizers are added to vaccines to help protect them from adverse conditions such as the freeze-drying process (for those vaccines that are freeze-dried) or heat. For freeze-dried (lyophilized) preparations of vaccines, it is also necessary to add materials that provide a bulk matrix for the vaccine. The amount of an immunogen that is contained in a vaccine can be extremely small, on the order of tens of micrograms or less. If sufficient amounts of various materials were not added to the vaccine before lyophilization, the vaccine would not be readily observable and would most likely adhere to the vial wall. By way of illustration of vaccine immunogen masses, ActHIB (Sanofi Pasteur SA), a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine that is marketed in a freeze-dried presentation, con- tains approximately 10 µg of purified polysaccharide conju- gated to 24 µg of tetanus toxoid. The immunogen mass for live viral vaccines is even less, on the order of nanograms (approximately 103 to 105 viral particles per dose). Thus, there is a need to provide a matrix to contain these vaccines during freeze-drying.",14,Buffers,Buffers,0.5722919300132137
The types of material that are added to vaccines as stabiliz-,14,Buffers,Buffers,1.0

"Added proteins may be of concern for two principal reasons. The first concern arises from the potential for animal- and human-derived protein to contain one or more adventi- tious agents. The second concern arises from the potential for these proteins to elicit an allergic reaction. The two animal- or human-derived proteins that are currently used as stabilizers in U.S.-licensed vaccines are human serum albumin (HSA) and gelatin. The FDA has, as of this writing, required that, if blood-derived HSA is used in vaccine manufacture, only U.S.- licensed HSA may be used. Additionally, an FDA guidance recommends that the following statement appear in the Warn- ings section of the package insert for blood-derived HSA- containing products28: “This product contains albumin, a",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Proteins,0.5160800914633489

"Gelatin or processed gelatin is also used as a stabilizer. Gelatin may be bovine or porcine derived. Despite the use of a harsh manufacturing procedure (extremes of heat and pH) in the production of gelatin, there is concern about the pres- ence of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent in bovine-derived material. Thus, any bovine-derived gelatin that is added to vaccines, or used in the vaccine manufacturing process, must not be sourced from countries reporting BSE or from countries that do not meet the latest BSE-related stan- dards of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) (see “Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents” later).29",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Proteins,1.0
"A second concern for gelatin relates to allergic responses. Allergic responses to gelatin, although rare, have been described in the medical literature.30–33 It has been hypothe- sized that in Japan, use of partially hydrolyzed gelatin, which contained a small amount of high-molecular-weight gelatin, contributed to an increase in the incidence of allergic reac- tions.33,34 Nakayama and Aizawa noted that a change to hydro- lyzed modified porcine gelatin, together with discontinuation of the use of gelatin-containing DTaP vaccines, may have con- tributed to a decrease in the incidence of allergic reactions after administration of monovalent measles and mumps vaccine in Japan.34 A severe allergic reaction to gelatin is a contraindication to receiving gelatin-containing vaccines.",13,Immunol,Immunol,1.0

For the purposes of this chapter, materials that are present in the final vaccine formulation that derive from the manufacturing process are termed residuals. Various steps in the manufacturing process may remove or reduce the amounts of many of these residuals. However, for various vac- cines, an acceptable technology to remove these manufactur- ing residuals may not exist, or there may be no perceived need (e.g., with regard to safety or a potential for an adverse effect on efficacy) for their removal. Additionally, and as a general principle, it is not possible to remove a particular substance completely, nor is it possible to demonstrate that a particular substance has been removed completely.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established a reference dose (RfD) for formaldehyde through the oral route.36 The RfD is defined by the EPA as “an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of mag- nitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure or a daily expo- sure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious noncancer effects during a lifetime.”37 The RfD for formalde- hyde (oral administration) is 0.2 mg/kg of bodyweight per day.36 The amount of residual formaldehyde in vaccines (which are administered infrequently, not daily) is below this level.",9,Formaldehyde,Formaldehyde,0.5837453634604792
Formaldehyde has been further classified by the EPA as a,8,Epa,Epa,0.8166760018825363
"“probable human carcinogen” (the EPA’s B1 classification).36 The bulk of the carcinogenicity studies on formaldehyde have focused on chronic respiratory exposure because this is the primary route of industrial and routine household expo- sure. There are fewer data regarding ingested or parenteral exposure to formaldehyde, and the EPA has not developed a risk estimate for either oral or parenteral exposure.36 Data regarding carcinogenicity studies may be found in documents from the EPA36 and the International Agency for Research on Cancer.38",8,Epa,Epa,0.8990315097665521
"One point regarding formaldehyde should be made. Form- aldehyde is naturally present in the human body as the result of various biochemical processes38,39 and the steady-state level of formaldehyde in the bloodstream of humans is approxi- mately 2.6 mg/L.40 The amount of formaldehyde that is natu- rally, continuously present in the blood of humans, or turned over in a particular day, is markedly in excess of the amount that is present as a vaccine residual. A 2013 FDA-authored study41 of the risk posed by the residual formaldehyde in vac- cines concluded, “In the absence of any known adverse health effects from endogenously produced formaldehyde, which exists in blood and extravascular water at steady-state concen- trations that are more than 100-fold higher [than are residual in vaccines], we consider vaccine-related, exogenous formal- dehyde to be a miniscule part of the daily formaldehyde turn- over by the body, and, therefore, do not find it plausible that vaccine-related formaldehyde represents an unsafe compo- nent of infant vaccines.”",9,Formaldehyde,Formaldehyde,1.0

"Vaccines derived from gram-negative bacteria may contain LPS, commonly termed endotoxin, a component of the bacte- rium’s outer membrane. Stimulation of the innate immune system by LPS can produce an inflammatory response that can result in fever, shock, and death.45 Different organisms have different LPS structures, so their respective response potentials differ. Two tests are currently used to detect LPS in vaccines: the rabbit pyrogen test (which is a test for all pyrogens) and the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test. The lysate from the amebocytes of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, clots in the presence of LPS and forms the basis for this test.46,47 In cases where pyrogenicity would be attributable to the presence of LPS, the LAL test is more commonly used. The limulus lysate that is used to test for bacterial endotoxin in U.S.- licensed vaccines (and other FDA-regulated biological prod- ucts) is itself a U.S.-licensed product.

After licensure, purity and quality of the vaccine antigen is often assessed by sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)–PAGE as a release test. However, there is a limit to the sensitivity of these methods, as is illustrated in publications of the National Institute of Allergy and Infec- tious Disease–sponsored multicenter acellular pertussis trial,51,52 which show that some children vaccinated with a fourth and fifth dose of Tripedia (DTaP [Sanofi Pasteur Inc.]; a two-component pertussis vaccine containing PT and fila- mentous hemagglutinin [FHA]), after previous doses of Tripe- dia, or a fourth dose of Tripedia after a primary series with whole-cell pertussis vaccine, had a booster response to pertac- tin and fimbriae, suggesting that there was sufficient antigen in Tripedia to stimulate an immune response.",25,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antigen,1.0

This included data from non- human primates showing that milligram amounts of DNA containing an activated oncogene from human tumor cells had not caused a tumor during 10 years of evaluation; consid- eration that human blood contains substantial amounts of DNA in plasma; and consideration that contaminating DNA in a biological product would probably be in small fragments that are unlikely to encode a functional gene.53 The committee concluded that continuous-cell-line DNA could be considered",15,Vaccines,Vaccines – Recombinant,1.0

Diagnosis of a TSE disease is definitively confirmed by post- mortem examination of brain tissue. However, even this exam- ination is limited in sensitivity because, at earlier stages of disease, the TSE agent may be present in undetectably low concentrations. Because of these limits on testing, potential contamination of animal-derived materials with TSE agents is controlled through restricted sourcing.29",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Proteins,1.0

This rule removed the USDA list of countries where BSE exists or that present an undue risk of BSE, and describes regions of risk generally similar to those classified by the OIE.
