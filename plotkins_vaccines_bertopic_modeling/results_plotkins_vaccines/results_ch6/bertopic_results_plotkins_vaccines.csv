"Adjuvants are substances that are added to vaccine antigens to enhance and modulate the immunogenicity of the antigen. The first adjuvants developed focused on increasing antibody responses, and this has often been sufficient for the vaccines considered. During the last 2 decades, however, it has been realized that simply increasing antibody responses is not always sufficient for candidate vaccines to be effective. It has been observed that adjuvants can be used very effectively to:",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0

"Generally speaking, adjuvants are useful for antigens such as inactivated, subunit, and recombinant proteins, which can lose, during the purification process, some of the immunologi- cal information present in the pathogen that are needed to trigger an immune response. They have not yet been required for live attenuated vaccines, which carry the necessary immune- stimulating signals themselves. As discussed later, however, some preliminary research suggests that adjuvants can have an effect on live vaccines as well.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
CHANCE AND NECESSITY: THE DISCOVERY OF ADJUVANTS,27,Adjuvants,Adjuvants – Categorization,1.0
"The use of adjuvants has been known for more than a century, and it is only recently that their mechanism of action was elucidated, in part owing to the progress in microbiology and immunology. The first recorded observation of immune potentiation by “adjuvants” is probably that of Coley, who in 1893 observed that administration of killed bacteria (Coley toxins) could in some cases cure certain forms of cancer. It was only in the 1990s that it was determined that this effect was the result of immune stimulation mediated by bacterial DNA. From there on, the specific oligonucleotide sequences that could stimulate the immune response and enhance it to a coadministered antigen were discovered.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
"It took another 2 decades to recognize the usefulness of adjuvants to enhance humoral immunity. In 1925, Ramon1 observed that administering diphtheria toxoid to horses with a variety of substances, including starch, plant extracts, or fish oils, substantially enhanced the antibody response to the toxoid. A year later, Glenny2 observed a similar effect with aluminum potassium sulfate, or alum. Alum was used there- after as an adjuvant for numerous human vaccines, and to this",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"day, other aluminum salts, in the form of aluminum oxyhy- droxide or hydroxyphosphate, are the most widely used adju- vants in human vaccines. The starch and fish oils shown by Ramon to act as adjuvants have, in recent decades, been tested in vaccines in the form of inulin and squalene, respectively.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"During the 80 years following the first use of aluminum salts as adjuvants, a wide variety of substances were tested as adjuvants, but many of them failed to be accepted for human use. In the 1940s, Jules Freund developed a water-in-oil emul- sion, the Freund adjuvant, in which the vaccine antigen is emulsified as water droplets in a continuous mineral oil phase, containing killed mycobacterium (Freund complete adjuvant) or not (Freund incomplete adjuvant). The latter was briefly used for a commercial influenza vaccine in the United Kingdom in the 1960s, but was soon withdrawn owing to unacceptable reactogenicity. This, however, led to the develop- ment of oil-in-water emulsions, in which oil droplets are present in a continuous aqueous phase.",3,Squalene,Squalene,0.24998043960892014
"The first oil-in-water emulsions were based on a nonme- tabolizable oil (squalane) and replaced later with metaboliz- able oils (squalene), as opposed to mineral oils as in the original Freund adjuvant. However, a water-in-oil emulsion similar in structure to the Freund adjuvant has been introduced in a cancer vaccine, using mineral oil with a higher degree of purity that allows for use in human vaccine candidates.",3,Squalene,Squalene,0.44807436178807053
"In the 1970s liposomes and virosomes that adsorb or encapsulate antigen were developed. Liposomes consist of lipid layers that form nanospheres or microspheres and can encapsulate or integrate antigens into their membranes. Several licensed vaccines contain virosomes, which are recon- stituted empty envelopes of influenza viruses similar in struc- ture to liposomes.",26,Virosomes,Virosomes,0.40314204121414654
A TURNING POINT: BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF IMMUNOLOGY AND ITS IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADJUVANTS,1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
"For most of the 20th century, adjuvant discovery and develop- ment was based on observations and experimentation with no clear immunological knowledge of the mechanism behind the adjuvant effect. This, however, dramatically changed in 1996 with the discovery of the Toll-like receptors (TLR) family in Drosophila and their relation to fungal resistance by Lemaitre and colleagues.3 One year later, in 1997, Janeway4 identified the link between human TLR4 and its key role in initiating an adaptive immune response, the first necessary step to a long-lasting immune response. The discovery by Poltorak and colleagues5 that TLR4 functioned as a lipopoly- saccharide (LPS)-sensing receptor and, hence, the use of LPSs or their derivatives as adjuvants, brought the final piece to the understanding of the mechanism of actions of TLR agonist molecules.6",34,Immunol,Immunol – Tlr4,1.0

"It is now well understood that the immune system uses pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to activate pathogen-recognition receptors such as TLR, and also a host of other more recently discovered receptors: retinoic-acid– inducible gene-based-I–like receptors (RLRs),8 and cytosolic nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs).9,10 These receptors bind various pathogen ligands (ranging from, for example, bacterial cell wall and cell mem- brane components to bacterial or viral nucleotides, to fungal lipids) to trigger different types of immune responses and, if combined with an antigen, can initiate and enhance specific arms of the immune responses to that antigen. For the purpose of brevity, readers are directed to other sources for a detailed description of how pathogen components stimulate various cytokine pathways and how they direct different arms of the immune response11; Fig. 6.1 shows this information schematically.

A Categorization of Adjuvants Based on Mechanism of Action,27,Adjuvants,Adjuvants – Categorization,1.0
"The majority of adjuvant reviews during recent decades have tried to classify adjuvants according to their mechanism of action and typically classified adjuvants as vehicles or immuno- stimulants. Immunostimulants are substances that act directly on the immune system, such as TLR ligands. Vehicles are thought to act primarily by presenting antigens to the immune system. In this group are various aluminum salts, emulsions, immunostimulatory immune complexes (ISCOMs), and bio- degradable microparticles. It is now known that most of the vehicles act directly on the immune system, and antigen pre- sentation may be only a minor component of the adjuvant activity (e.g., see the later discussions of modes of action of aluminum salts [“Aluminum Salt Adjuvants”] and oil-in-water emulsions [“Oil-in-Water Emulsions”]). This classification seems outdated, and it may be preferable to classify adjuvants according to their receptor or, when the receptor is unknown, by their physical or chemical nature.",31,Immune,Immune – Adjuvants,1.0

"Structure and Properties. Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant is not Al(OH)3, but rather crystalline aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH).17 This difference is important because crystalline aluminum hydroxide has a low surface area (approximately 20 to 50 m2/g) and as such is a poor adsorbent. Crystalline aluminum oxyhydroxide has a surface area of approximately 500 m2/g,18 which makes it an excellent adsorbent. This high surface area is a result of its morphology. The primary particles are fibers having dimensions of approximately 5 × 2 × 200 nm.",10,Adjuvant,Adjuvant – Aluminium,0.8415728241542223
"Aluminum oxyhydroxide is a stoichiometric compound. The surface is composed of Al-OH and Al-O-Al groups. The Al-OH surface groups can accept a proton, resulting in a posi- tive surface charge, or donate a proton, resulting in a negative surface charge. As shown in Fig. 6.2, the isoelectric point (IEP) of Al-OH is 11.4.

"Alum, which is water-soluble, is chemically aluminum potassium sulfate, AlK(SO4)2. The earliest vaccines containing aluminum adjuvants were prepared by in situ precipitation. A solution of alum was mixed with a solution of the antigen dissolved in a phosphate buffer. It is common practice to refer to the adjuvant produced by in situ precipitation as alum. The precipitate is amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate and has similar composition and properties as aluminum phos- phate adjuvant.17,20",6,Adjuvants,Adjuvants – Alum,1.0

"Effect of Freezing. Vaccines containing aluminum hydroxide adjuvant or aluminum phosphate adjuvant should not be allowed to freeze and should not be used if suspected of having been exposed to freezing temperatures.22 Freezing may affect the aluminum-containing adjuvant and the adsorbed antigen. Coagulates, which cannot be redispersed by shaking, form when aluminum-containing adjuvants are frozen. Ther- mostability of vaccines is of increasing importance, and as demonstrated for aluminium salts does not only concern excursion at high temperature, but also at low temperature, such as freezing.",38,Vaccines,Vaccines – Freezing,1.0
"Adsorption Mechanisms. The major mechanisms responsi- ble for the adsorption of antigens are electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic forces, and ligand exchange. Electrostatic attrac- tion is probably the most frequently used adsorption mechanism.",8,Adjuvant,Adjuvant – Adsorption,0.9729549588413738
"Electrostatic attraction can be optimized by determining the IEP of the antigen and then selecting an adjuvant that will have the opposite surface charge at the desired pH. For example, at pH 7.4, aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (IEP = 11.4) adsorbs albumin (IEP = 4.8) but does not adsorb lyso- zyme (IEP = 11.0). In contrast, aluminum phosphate adjuvant (IEP = 4.0) adsorbs lysozyme but not albumin at pH 7.4.23",8,Adjuvant,Adjuvant – Adsorption,0.5786709024600996
Care must be taken in selecting a buffer for an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant–containing vaccine. Electrostatic attrac- tion for an acidic antigen may be reduced or reversed if a phosphate buffer is used. Acetate and tromethamine (TRIS) are examples of buffers that do not alter the IEP of aluminum hydroxide adjuvant.17,8,Adjuvant,Adjuvant – Adsorption,0.39064358837660706
Aluminum hydroxide adjuvant can also be pretreated to lower the IEP to optimize electrostatic adsorption of basic antigens.24,8,Adjuvant,Adjuvant – Adsorption,0.5411890702702791
"Hydrophobic forces can also contribute to the adsorption of antigens by aluminum-containing adjuvants. The contribu- tion of hydrophobic attractive forces can be determined by observing the effect of ethylene glycol on adsorption.25 Ethylene glycol stabilizes the hydration layer of proteins, which renders hydrophobic interactions thermodynamically unfavorable.",8,Adjuvant,Adjuvant – Adsorption,1.0
"Mechanisms of Action of Aluminum Salt Adjuvants. There is still no consensus regarding the mechanisms by which aluminum-containing adjuvants potentiate the immune response. Several mechanisms are frequently cited to explain how aluminum-containing adjuvants increase antibody pro- duction. The depot mechanism was initially thought of as the dominant one; later the promotion of uptake of antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs)26 and, more recently, a direct immune-stimulating mechanism were proposed.",36,Adjuvants,Adjuvants – Immune,0.8020875801076166
"The depot mechanism postulates that the aluminum- containing adjuvant and the adsorbed antigen remain at the site of injection. The antigen is released slowly to stimulate the production of antibodies. This hypothesis is supported by the observation with some antigens that stronger binding to the aluminum salt crystals can result in higher immune responses. This hypothesis is, however, inconsistent with the observation that alum injection sites can be excised shortly after injection with no impact on immunogenicity.27",36,Adjuvants,Adjuvants – Immune,1.0
"It has also been proposed that adsorption of antigen to aluminum-containing adjuvants converts the soluble antigen to a particulate form. APCs take up particulate matter more efficiently by phagocytosis. Thus, antigen, which remains adsorbed, is taken into macrophages and dendritic cells. A dendritic cell culture study28 revealed that antigens that elute from the aluminum-containing adju- vants are internalized by macropinocytosis, while those that remain adsorbed are internalized by phagocytosis. Antigen internalization by dendritic cells was enhanced when the antigen remained adsorbed to the aluminum-containing adjuvant following administration and when the aggregate size of the adjuvant was smaller than dendritic cells.",6,Adjuvants,Adjuvants – Alum,0.744908614746816
"Several groups have identified a role for a direct stimulation of the immune system through innate immune receptors and identified activation of the Natch domain, leucine-rich repeat, and PYD-containing protein (NALP)-3 inflamma- some pathway by alum as the mechanism of action.29–31 The precise mechanism by which alum stimulated NALP3 remained unknown.

It is likely that all three proposed mechanisms contribute to the immunostimulation produced by aluminum-containing adjuvants.,36,Adjuvants,Adjuvants – Immune,1.0
"Safety of Aluminum-Containing Vaccines. Aluminum salts as adjuvants have the longest and largest safety track record of all adjuvanted vaccines, with more than 3 billion vaccine doses used during the past 80 years with a positive risk-to- benefit ratio. Focal histologic lesions were observed in patients with diffuse muscular symptoms that included persistent myalgias, arthralgias, and persistent fatigue. In the approxi- mately 130 cases studied, these lesions were identified as mac- rophagic myofasciitis (MMF).33 Intracytoplasmic inclusions in the infiltrating macrophages have been identified as contain- ing aluminum by electron microscopy, microanalysis, and atomic adsorption spectroscopy. The presence of aluminum in the deltoid muscle biopsies suggested to Gherardi and col- leagues that the source of the aluminum was aluminum hydroxide adjuvant.34 However, no relationship between the presence of aluminum and MMF and the clinical symptoms has been established. The Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed MMF at a meeting in 1999. The committee found that there was no basis for recommending a change in vaccination practices involving vaccine selection, schedule, delivery practices, or information involving aluminum-containing vaccines. The committee recommended that “research studies be under- taken to evaluate the clinical, epidemiological, and basic science aspects of MMF.”35 The U.S. Food and Drug Adminis- tration, while recognizing the desirability of new adjuvants, confirmed its support of aluminum salts in vaccines.36 Research studies undertaken to assess the neurotoxicity of aluminum when it is administered intramuscularly or in a vaccine, showed a difference between the control group and the aluminum-based vaccine tested.37 A repeat of the experiment, however, did not confirm any differences between the control group and the two vaccines containing aluminum. To date, even though it is established that aluminium salt can be recov- ered at the injection site months or years after intramuscular injections, no link between the presence of aluminium salt and the MMF syndrome has been clearly established.",30,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants – T30,0.7653796142649086
Water-in-Oil Emulsions,9,Emulsions,Emulsions,1.0
"Water-in-oil emulsions, of which the Freund adjuvant is the best-known example, were included in a commercial influenza vaccine in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. The vaccine was later withdrawn owing to occasional abscesses observed at the site of injection. Initial large-scale clinical studies on 18,000 military recruits conducted in 195338,39 resulted in some nodules at the injection sites, which were attributed to impuri- ties (short-chain fatty acids) in the Arlacel-A surfactant. However, when this surfactant was purified, the incidence of cysts was reduced. A 10-year follow-up on these volunteers40 showed that cyst-like reactions had required hospitalization in 0.1% to 0.6% of the volunteers, but otherwise there were no adverse effects of the vaccine. A subsequent 35-year follow-up41 demonstrated that not only were there no adverse correlations with different diagnoses, including autoimmune diseases, but also, for some of the disease categories, there was decreased mortality. In contrast with these data from a large clinical trial, studies in rodents in 1972 demonstrated that when male Swiss mice were injected with mineral oil–based",3,Squalene,Squalene,0.314042433131353

"As a result, water-in-oil emulsions based on metabolizable oil were developed using squalene instead of mineral oil. The best-known examples of these are the Montanide adjuvants such as ISA 720 produced by the company Seppic. ISA 720 water-in-oil emulsion has been widely tested in more than 70 clinical trials in which it was often shown to induce immune responses rarely surpassed by other adjuvants. However, as with mineral oil–based emulsions, cysts or sterile abscesses at the site of injection are not infrequent and tend to increase in frequency on boosting.43 In addition, instability of the antigen in contact with the emulsion was observed.44 Finally, the dif- ficulty in performing reproducible formulation at the time of administration led to a preformulation that may be incompat- ible with antigen stability. These challenges suggest that for prophylactic vaccines, researchers should, when possible, avoid using water-in-oil emulsions. For therapeutic vaccines, however, the risk of cysts and the challenges of formulation may be less significant. Such a vaccine (CIMAvax), which con- tains a mineral oil–based water-in oil-emulsion, Montanide ISA 51, has been licensed in Cuba for non–small cell lung cancer.45",3,Squalene,Squalene,0.35603686981321225
Oil-in-Water Emulsions,9,Emulsions,Emulsions,1.0
"Oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants were initially developed as an alternative to water-in-oil emulsions; the lower viscosity makes them easier to inject. The first emulsion of this class to be developed for human use was the SAF adjuvant made by Syntex Corporation. This emulsion was based on nonbiode- gradable squalane, the catalytically hydrogenated form of squalene, and was designed as a vehicle to carry a synthetic immunostimulant, threonyl muramyl dipeptide (MDP).46 The SAF adjuvant, while displaying strong adjuvant activity, was too reactogenic for use, partially because of MDP. However, because it was less effective without the immunostimulant, the emulsion was abandoned. Later, Chiron Corporation devel- oped a range of oil-in-water emulsions by replacing squalane with squalene as another vehicle for muramyl derivatives. One of these emulsions (MF59) demonstrated some adjuvant properties and was further evaluated. MF59 and the majority of the later-developed oil-in-water emulsions used squalene, a natural, metabolizable product found in all plant and animal cells where it is a precursor of cholesterol. The com- mercial source is generally from shark liver, where it is abun- dant; alternative sources such as phytosqualene are being explored.47 However, to date, only squalene from shark origin allows for a product with a purity level acceptable for human use.",3,Squalene,Squalene,0.4491227129052294
Despite extensive clinical studies with a wide range of anti-,13,Anti,Anti,1.0
"gens, MF59 was approved only in one vaccine, FLUAD, an influenza vaccine for older adults, and licensed in several European countries from 1997 onward. While there was benefit of the adjuvanted vaccine in terms of antibody response to the influenza hemagglutinin in the target population,48 the really significant benefit of MF59 and other oil-in-water emul- sions became clear during investigations on pandemic influ- enza vaccines. The emergence of avian H5N1 influenza with occasional human-to-human transmission and the fear that this could become a pandemic led to intensive research in academic and pharmaceutical environments for ways to immunize a largely immunologically naïve population in the context of limited antigen supplies. This was especially critical when it was shown that for an H5N1 pandemic strain, sixfold more antigen was required to induce an immune response to a level equivalent to the seasonal influenza vaccine (90 µg",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Mf59,1.0

"Adjuvant Effect of Oil-in-Water Emulsions on Naïve Versus Primed Persons. Oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants are highly effective at enhancing immunogenicity and allowing for dose reduction in pandemic influenza vaccines when the vaccinees are naïve. In contrast, the adjuvant effect for seasonal vaccines in healthy adults is quite poor.58 This suggests that these adju- vants are excellent for priming but do not boost efficiently preexisting immune responses. The benefit for priming is also evident in the studies on the use of MF59-adjuvanted seasonal vaccine in infants, who usually respond poorly to a single administration of seasonal vaccine. These studies show a strong effect of MF59 on immunogenicity59 and on efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines, with the effect being strongest in the youngest ages.60 The adjuvanted vaccine demonstrated 89% efficacy against vaccine-matched strains during two influ- enza seasons compared with 45% for the nonadjuvanted sea- sonal influenza vaccines group. On the basis of these data, Canada approved in early 2015 the use of MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine (FLUAD Pediatric) for the pediatric population (6 months to 2 years of age).",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"Enhancing the Breadth of the Immune Response. Possi- bly one of the most important breakthroughs in adjuvant research during the last few years was the observation during the development of H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccines that oil-in-water adjuvants not only enhance the immune response and allow for dose reduction, but also enhance diversity and affinity of the antibodies induced.63 This qualitative and quan- titative expansion of the antibody repertoire has tremendous relevance for vaccination against pathogens, which undergo frequent antigenic drifts, such as influenza, as this would reduce the need for a perfect match between the antigen and the circulating pathogen strain.",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Mf59,1.0
"This observation was first demonstrated in the ferret chal- lenge model with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine through cross-neutralizing antibodies and lethal challenge.64 The cross- neutralizing antibodies were confirmed later in clinical set- tings using the same AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine.65 Data published with MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine showed the induction of epitope spreading from HA2 to HA1 hemagglu- tinin and to neuraminidase, suggesting that this is a common feature of this family of adjuvants. MF59 adjuvant enhances diversity and affinity of antibody-mediated immune response to pandemic influenza vaccines.66",0,Vaccines,Vaccines – Mf59,1.0
"Mode of Action. For many years oil-in-water emulsions were classified as vehicles, and it was assumed that the mode of action was primarily through enhanced delivery of the antigen to APCs or to the lymph nodes, even though most antigens do not associate physically to the oil droplets. It has, however, been shown that these emulsions stimulate the immune response indirectly. Using gene microarray analysis, Mosca and colleagues67 demonstrated that skeletal muscle fibers are the target of MF59, where the adjuvant induces production of PTX3 and JunB, which, in turn, stimulate pro- duction of TNF-α, IL-1B, and CCLs (chemokines C-C ligands), resulting in activation of resident APCs and recruitment and activation of circulating APCs. A similar mechanism has also been demonstrated for the α-tocopherol–containing oil-in- water emulsion, AS03. Morel and colleagues68 showed that similarly to MF59, AS03 induces expression of a range of cytokines, granulocyte recruitment at the injection site, and",31,Immune,Immune – Adjuvants,0.9541745666257573
"increased antigen uptake by monocytes and migration to the draining lymph node. In this adjuvant, however, the expres- sion of some of the cytokines, such as IL-6, was modulated by the presence of α-tocopherol, which also enhanced the mag- nitude of the immune response, suggesting an immunomodu- latory action of α-tocopherol independent of the oil emulsion. The same authors also demonstrated that the adjuvant effect is local and that temporal and spatial colocalization of antigen and adjuvant were required; that is, injecting the adjuvant in a site distant to the antigen or at a later time resulted in no adjuvant effect, consistent with a local and short-lived direct impact of the immune system.",31,Immune,Immune – Adjuvants,1.0
"Safety of Squalene-Containing Oil-in-Water Emulsions. During the H1N1 pandemic, two influenza vaccines contain- ing an oil-in-water emulsion as adjuvant were approved and distributed in Europe (Pandemrix and Focetria); however, the uptake of these vaccines was hampered by broad media claims of the dangers of squalene. Many of these concerns seem to have arisen from a 2002 report that soldiers return- ing from the Gulf War with the so-called Gulf War syndrome had antisqualene antibodies that had been induced through receiving vaccines allegedly containing squalene.69 Although the vaccines in question did not apparently contain squa- lene, the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety reviewed all available data, including data from clini- cal trials with the squalene-containing FLUAD vaccine. Animal studies have also suggested that squalene can induce arthritis.70 However, in the animal model used, the require- ment for a specific breed and the use of a complex protocol irrelevant to the vaccination practice make it difficult to assess the relevance of these data for safety evaluation in humans. The committee concluded that there was no evi- dence that squalene could induce pathological antisqualene antibodies. Before recommending the use of squalene- containing oil-in-water emulsion for the H1N1 pandemic, the WHO also reviewed all clinical data from more than 35,000 volunteers of all ages and concluded that there were no significant safety concerns.",3,Squalene,Squalene,1.0

"Although LPS, a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, has long been known to be a potent stimulator of the immune system, its use in adjuvants has been curtailed by its toxic effects. Early studies demonstrated that removing the core carbohydrate, generating lipid A, reduced the pyrogenicity without reducing the immune- stimulating activity. Lipid A was still too pyrogenic for use; however, it was shown that formulating lipid A in liposomes reduced the pyrogenicity a further 100- to 1000-fold, and lipo- somal lipid A formulations were used in clinical trials for candidate malaria vaccines without severe adverse events.76 In 1984, Ribi77 demonstrated that a significantly less-toxic mol- ecule could be obtained from LPS through sequential acidic and basic hydrolysis steps. The phosphate from the reducing- end glucosamine of lipid A derived from Salmonella minnesota RC595 is removed by mild acid hydrolysis, resulting in a mol- ecule, referred to as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA, referring to all other TLR4 agonists) that was significantly less toxic than the lipid A and that still stimulated the immune response.7 Ribi and colleagues then observed that if this MPLA was sub- jected to a further mild alkali hydrolysis, which selectively removed the acyl chain from the 3′ position of the disaccha- ride backbone, the resulting molecule, 3-deacylated MPLA (3d-MPL, or MPL), was even less pyrogenic but still exhibited adjuvant activity.

"Mechanism of Action of TLR4 Agonists. Immune recogni- tion of TLR4 agonists, such as LPS or MPL, is initiated by extraction of monomers from the aggregates by LPS-binding protein in the serum.80 Monomeric LPS is transferred from LPS-binding protein to another accessory protein, CD14, which, in turn, transfers LPS to MD2, a secreted glycoprotein that associates with the extracellular domain of TLR4 to form the heterodimeric receptor that is responsible for the physio- logical recognition of LPS.81 Lipid A bound to the TLR4–MD2 complex activates two distinct intracellular signaling path- ways, which have come to be known by the names of the TLR4-proximal adaptor proteins, myeloid differentiation 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β (TRIF).82 The Myd88 pathway leads to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase– and nuclear factor-κB– dependent proinflammatory responses, whereas the TRIF pathway activates kinases responsible for type I interferon responses.83 Fig. 6.1 shows this schematically. To this extent, the TLR4 receptor is unique among the TLRs by its ability to induce two distinct signaling pathways. The activation of these pathways is dependent on the structure of the agonist, where minor changes in the number and length of the acyl chains can have a major effect on pathway activation. MPL has been reported to activate the TLR4-TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule)-TRIF–based signaling pathway and the TLR4-MAL (MyD88 adaptor-like)-MyD88 pathway.84",34,Immunol,Immunol – Tlr4,1.0
"Species Specificity of TLR4 Receptor. One challenge exists, however, in the development of TLR4 agonists for use in humans—the variability in the receptor specificity across species. Human, but not murine, TLR4–MD2 transmits proin- flammatory signals in response to hexaacylated but not pen- taacylated LPS.85 Moreover, in humans, but less so in rodents, tetraacylated and pentaacylated forms can inhibit the adjuvant activity. As a result, molecules shown to work in rodents will not necessarily function the same way in humans. One example of this is the OM-174 molecule, a triacylated mole- cule that functioned in mice,86 but apparently did not function in humans.",5,Vaccines,Vaccines – Tlr4,1.0

"Formulation Challenges. Ensuring an optimal and repro- ducible adjuvant effect requires some formulation knowhow. In the currently approved vaccines with TLR4 agonists (Cer- varix and Fendrix), the MPL is combined with an aluminum salt, and the combination of the two adjuvants is referred to as AS04. The combination of MPL with an aluminum salt adjuvant demonstrates some of the challenges of using MPL and analogous multiacylated disaccharide TLR4 agonists. Only a well-defined and controlled process can ensure that those molecules, which are insoluble in water, will not clump into aggregates that would lead to difficulty during sterilization by filtration or variability in the adjuvant activity. Various other approaches have been adopted to formulate TLR4 agonists, such as their incorporation into small unilamellar liposomes permitting a stable formulation. However, the activity is dependent on the ratio of lipid to agonist and how the agonist is combined with the liposomes.96 Other alternatives include the incorporation of the agonists into oil-in-water emulsions or application of thermal or sonic energy to form colloids, which can be further stabilized by the addition of small quanti- ties of lipids. The immune enhancement induced by TLR4 agonists is highly dependent on the physical structures, and determination of the consistency and stability of these requires detailed physicochemical characterization.97 Successful use of these adjuvants, therefore, requires careful consideration of how to formulate them and how these amphipathic molecules will interact with other components of the vaccine, such as surfactants, aluminum salts, and antigens.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"Although obtaining pure CpG-containing oligonucleotides is easy, the development of this class of molecules as adjuvants for human vaccines is severely hampered by the fact that the specific hexameric CpG motifs inducing optimal immune enhancement differ between species.98 Hence, evaluation of efficacy and safety in rodents is not readily translated to humans. Furthermore, the distribution of the TLR9 receptor and the pathways that its activation promotes also differ across species. In humans, CpG motifs are recognized by TLR9 found on natural killer (NK) cells,101 B cells, and plasmacytoid den- dritic cells,98 but are not recognized by myeloid dendritic cells and monocytes. In contrast, in mice, those cells express TLR9, which recognizes CpG motifs. In both species, CpG motifs trigger B-cell activation and induce directly or indirectly the production of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α, and interferon-γ; in some cases, CpG can redirect preestablished Th2 responses toward Th1.102 CpG ODNs also act as adjuvants for antigens delivered by the mucosal route of administration.103",7,Immunol,Immunol – Dna,1.0

The influenza vaccine Grippol licensed in Russia contains polyoxidonium,141 a poly- electrolyte copolymer of N-oxide 1,4-ethylene piperazine and (N-carboxyethyl)-1,4-ethylene piperidium bromide, that has immunostimulatory properties.142 Even though little has been published about this specific polymer and its use as an adjuvant, an analogous polymer, poly(carboxylatophenoxy) phosphazene (PCPP) has been widely investigated as an adju- vant for vaccines and has been shown to exert adjuvant activity.143,144",12,Vaccine,Vaccine – Polyelectrolytes,0.6431715866587703
"Polycations such as polyarginine,145 chitosan,146,147 and cat- ionic lipids148 have also been shown to exert adjuvant activity. As for polyelectrolytes, the mode of action is not fully under- stood but is likely to involve interaction with cell membranes similar to that described for alum.32 Another cationic adju- vant, CAF01, is a liposome-based adjuvant composed of the cationic quaternary ammonium lipid dimethyldioctadecylam- monium (DDA) and the synthetic analog of mycobacterial cord factor; trehalose-dibehenate (TDB). CAF01 was originally developed as a CMI-promoting adjuvant for a subunit vaccine against TB, but the adjuvant has since been demonstrated to promote a diverse immune response resulting in CMI and humoral responses149,150 and is in clinical evaluation.",15,Vaccine,Vaccine – Polyarginine,0.5869740847257446
"Mucosal Adjuvants. There is a strong interest in the vaccine community in administering vaccines via the mucosal route. This route offers the advantages of being easier to administer and not requiring trained health care workers, but also has the potential of inducing mucosal immunity at the portal of entry of many pathogens. While mucosal delivery and induction of mucosal immunity can easily be achieved with live attenuated vaccines (e.g., oral poliovirus vaccines, oral rotavirus vaccines, nasally administered live attenuated influenza vaccines), inducing systemic or mucosal immunity with nonlive antigens is much more difficult. These tend to be nonimmunogenic or poorly immunogenic via the mucosal routes; consequently, numerous adjuvants have been evaluated to enhance the immunogenicity.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,0.6839763459924991
The most widely investigated are the bacterial adenosine,-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylating exotoxins such as cholera holotoxin and E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin.151 Even though these are potent mucosal adjuvants, their toxicity has, for the most part, precluded their use as adjuvants. Consequently, mutations have been introduced in an attempt to reduce their toxicity while aiming to retain some adjuvant activity.152 These include adjuvants such as mLT(R192G), dmLT,153 and LTK63.154,155 For nasal delivery, these adjuvants have, however, presented unacceptable safety concerns. The native toxin was used as an adjuvant in an intranasal influenza vaccine that was licensed in Switzerland but was associated with occasional severe adverse events in the form of Bell palsy (partial facial paralysis) ascribed to the adjuvant,156 and similar effects were seen in an experimental vaccine using the LTH63 detoxified mutant.157 These adjuvants all contain the pentamer B subunit of the toxin, which binds ganglioside GM1 on nerves and can be transported through retroaxonal transport to the root of the nerve; it is thought that the neurological adverse events may have arisen through such an interaction.157 An alternative adjuvant, which does not contain the B subunit and, hence, does not bind GM1 gangliosides, is CTA1-DD, which is cur- rently in development.158,159 These exotoxins also have been",11,Paralysis,Paralysis,0.22941319049973208
"evaluated for oral delivery in several clinical trials; however, their susceptibility to acidic environments requires enteric for- mulations.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS,23,Directions,Directions,1.0
"The past decade has seen an unprecedented surge in under- standing how adjuvants work. While the history of adjuvant discovery and development has evolved through serendipity, we are now in a position in which identification, selection, and use of adjuvants can be rationalized. This has opened the door to vaccine candidates against as yet unmet medical needs—vaccines that will not only prevent infectious diseases, but might also treat life-threatening diseases such as cancers or enable management of chronic disorders such as Alzheimer disease. Adjuvants appear also as a potential route to improve on current licensed vaccines that may be less efficient in a specific target population that requires a stronger stimulation on the immune system to develop a protective immune response.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
"There are a number of factors and unknowns that need to be considered. The most important of these is how to demon- strate the safety of adjuvants. As pointed out several times, there is an underlying concern that is not necessarily based on sound science that adjuvants can induce immune-mediated disorders. The absence of suitable animal models and the dif- ferences in receptors and receptor distribution between animals and humans can make it difficult in some cases to demonstrate that this is not the case.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
"Despite the occurrence of autoimmune reactions in the general population, the fear that adjuvants can induce or exac- erbate autoimmune disorders is one that is at the forefront of follow-up and surveillance. Holding clinical development of a vaccine based on a single adverse event demonstrates the challenges of developing vaccines with novel adjuvants. The risk-to-benefit balance associated with the vaccine being devel- oped will always be the guiding principle for ascertaining the value of a given approach. A large safety database to demon- strate rare events in such studies is not always possible, which underlines the difficulty introducing new approaches into the field of vaccines. The paucity of epidemiologic data on such immune-mediated disorders, which are key to establishing the background rate of disease, needs to be addressed so that factual analysis can be undertaken when such events occur.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
The safety evaluation of a vaccine encompasses all constitu-,-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"ents of the product. It cannot be assumed that an adjuvant that is safe in one vaccine with a given antigen will be safe when added to another vaccine, even if the latter vaccine is safe without adjuvant. A rational approach requires nonclini- cal toxicology, determination of the mode of action of the adjuvant, an evaluation of differences in receptors and activity in animal and human cells, controlled clinical trials, and post- marketing surveillance.161",32,Vaccine,Vaccine – Adjuvant,0.2857654161634007
"Also, adequate formulation is critical for the activity of many adjuvants. Yet the knowhow for adjuvant formulation is not widely available, even though predicting how the physi- cochemical parameters of an adjuvant and its interaction with the antigen affect immune responses is key to its selection. All these points emphasize the criticality of process development, robustness, and reproducibility, and the ability to characterize adjuvants in a relevant and efficient way.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
"A host of adjuvants are now in clinical development; however, none tested in humans so far has the ability to induce functional CD8+ T-cells to a level that can be seen with live viral vaccines. Live viral vaccines have their limitations, in particular with respect to repeated boosting and their use in",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
"immune-suppressed persons. There is, therefore, a need to pursue research into adjuvants capable of inducing CD8+ T-cell responses.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
"Finally, because vaccines are built on the combination of antigen(s) and adjuvant(s), the need for relevant and immu- nogenic antigens should not be overlooked. Because more and more vaccines will require the induction of both humoral immunity and CMI, there is a need for researchers to seek to improve the intrinsic immunogenicity of the antigen and to ensure optimum immune responses if the addition of an adju- vant is required.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,0.7934379024567266
"It is only through the appropriate combination of antigen and adjuvant, selected on the basis of the targeted disease, relevant protective immune response, and target population, that adjuvants will fulfill their promises and find their place as a relevant and effective tool for improving human health.",1,Vaccines,Vaccines – Adjuvants,1.0
