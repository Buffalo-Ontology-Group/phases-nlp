"Vaccination as a deliberate attempt to protect humans against disease has a short history when measured against the thou- sands of years that humans have sought to rid themselves of plagues and pestilence. Only in the 20th century did the prac- tice flower into the routine vaccination of large populations. Yet, despite its relative youth, the impact of vaccination on the health of the world’s peoples is hard to exaggerate. With the exception of safe water, no other intervention, not even anti- biotics, has had such a major effect on mortality reduction and population growth.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Since the first vaccine was introduced by Edward Jenner (Fig. 1.1) in 1798, vaccination has controlled 14 major dis- eases, at least in parts of the world: smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella, typhoid, rabies, rotavirus, and hepatitis B. For smallpox, the dream of eradication has been fulfilled; naturally occurring smallpox has disappeared from the world.1 Cases of poliomyelitis have been reduced by 99% and this disease also is targeted for eradication. Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome have been officially declared eliminated from the Americas as of 2015.2 Vaccinations against many other diseases have made major headway. The path to these successes is worth examining.3–5",74,Rubella,Rubella – Vaccination,1.0
EARLY DEVELOPMENTS,39,Decades,Decades,1.0
"Attempts to “vaccinate” began long before Edward Jenner’s smallpox vaccination. While the precise origin of variolation remains unknown, it seems to have developed somewhere in Central Asia in the early part of the second millennium and then spread east to China and west to Turkey, Africa, and finally Europe.",0,Smallpox,Smallpox – Variolation,0.8286463780349094
"In the 7th century, some Indian Buddhists drank snake venom in an attempt to become immune to its effect. They may have been inducing antitoxin-like immunity.6 In the 16th century, Brahmin Hindus in India practiced a form of variola- tion by introducing dried pus from smallpox pustules into the skin of a patient.7 Writings that cite the use of inoculation and variolation in 10th-century China8–10 make interesting reading but apparently cannot be verified.11 There is, however, 18th-century documentation of Chinese variolation. The Golden Mirror of Medicine, a medical text dated 1742, listed four forms of inoculation against smallpox practiced in China since 1695:",0,Smallpox,Smallpox – Variolation,0.591181834227342

"Variolation was introduced into England by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in 1721, after her return from Constanti- nople, where she lived for 2 years with her husband, the British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Lady Montagu had been disfigured by smallpox earlier in life and her 20-year- old brother had died of the disease. While living in Turkey, she frequently observed variolation and wrote to a friend back home: “The small-pox, so fatal, and so general amongst us, is here entirely harmless, by the invention of engrafting, which is the term they give it…. Every year, thousands undergo this operation…they take the small-pox here by way of diversion, as they take the waters in other countries. There is no example of any one that has died in it….”12 So impressed was she that she had her own son variolated while still living in Turkey. Dr. Charles Maitland, who performed the procedure on her son in Constantinople, later performed the first variolation in England in 1721 on Lady Montagu’s daughter. The treatment was effective, but results were erratic, and 2% to 3% of persons treated died of smallpox contracted from the variolation itself.13",0,Smallpox,Smallpox – Variolation,0.8170343539887398
The English medical community had previously learned of,-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"variolation in 1713 when Emanuel Timoni, MD, a graduate of Oxford University living in Turkey, sent a letter to the Royal Society about variolation. Another physician, Giacomo Pilar- ino, also reported Turkish variolation to the Royal Society in 1716.14 The reports did not seem to be significant, and the procedure was not adopted.15 An earlier hint of variolation is made by the Danish physician Thomas Bartholin of Copen- hagen in 1675, who mentioned that there was a “market” in Copenhagen where people would go to buy the poxvirus from enterprising housewives. It is unclear whether these purchases were for the prevention of smallpox in healthy persons or for the treatment of persons already infected.15–19 Voltaire lauded the variolation of Circassian women to maintain their beauty in his Lettres Philosophiques in 1721.",0,Smallpox,Smallpox – Variolation,1.0
"Most intriguing, at the same time that Charles Maitland variolated Lady Montagu’s daughter in England (1721), vari- olation was practiced in America at the instigation of Cotton Mather who first learned of it from his African slave, Onesi- mus.15 Mather subsequently read about variolation in volume 29 of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 1714 to 1716, which contained the aforementioned articles by Timoni and Pilarino. There was a smallpox epidemic in Boston at that time, and Mather used the authority and pres- tige of his position to urge all Boston-area physicians to con- sider the practice of variolation (letter, June 24,1721).

"response was negative, except for Dr. Zabdiel Boylston, who successfully inoculated his own 6-year-old son and two black slaves shortly thereafter. Six weeks later, Dr. Boylston vario- lated Mather’s son, Sammy, and publicized its success. Mather continued to harangue recalcitrant physicians and the public about variolation to the point where a grenade was thrown into his house in utter exasperation!20,21",0,Smallpox,Smallpox – Variolation,1.0
"Despite the known risks, George Washington was com- pelled in the 1770s to order that Continental Army recruits undergo variolation against smallpox, to which the Americans were highly susceptible; the great majority of their English enemies were immune from early childhood exposure or from variolation.22 In the mid-18th century, several treatises were written on inoculation against measles as well; the Scottish physician Francis Home successfully inoculated humans against measles and published his results (1758).23–25",0,Smallpox,Smallpox – Variolation,0.8253736638136684
"In 1774 in Yetminster, England (Dorset County), a cattle breeder named Benjamin Jesty, himself immune to smallpox after contracting cowpox from his herd, deliberately inocu- lated his wife and two children with cowpox to avoid a small- pox epidemic.14 This was no spur-of-the-moment idea; like many country farmers in the area, he knew that dairymaids seemed to be protected from smallpox after they had con- tracted cowpox. He had considered the possibility of deliber- ately using the inoculation technique with cowpox for quite some time and acted only when there was an imminent threat of a smallpox outbreak. He took his wife and two children to a nearby field where he knew he could find cattle with cowpox. He inoculated all three of them. His experiment succeeded; they were unaffected by the outbreak, and his two sons were still immune 15 years later, when they were deliberately vari- olated with smallpox.26–28",78,Smallpox,Smallpox – Cowpox,1.0

"dairymaids’ immunity to smallpox because of prior infection with cowpox and saw the principle involved: inoculation with one moderately harmless disease (cowpox) could provide pro- tection against another far more dangerous disease, smallpox. When Jesty’s neighbors learned that his wife had developed inflammation at the site of the inoculation and had to be treated by a physician because he had “vaccinated” her, they vehemently scorned him.28 Jesty retreated in the face of their disapproval and never attempted to publicize his experiment or to vaccinate anyone else.27 Truly, Jesty’s actions constituted the first known real vaccination—the use of cowpox to protect against smallpox.",78,Smallpox,Smallpox – Cowpox,1.0
"Some 30 years later, after Jenner had popularized vaccina- tion, and thanks to the intercession of an enthusiastic vaccina- tor named Rev. Andrew Bell, Jesty was invited to London in 1805 by the Original Vaccine Pock Institute to tell the story of his 1774 “experiment” before the Institute’s examiners. At the end of the visit, they issued a public statement in the Edinburgh Medical & Surgical Journal recognizing Jesty’s cowpox vaccina- tion. They commissioned his portrait as well, which was hung in the Institute.27,28 This was a vindication of sorts, but he did not share in the significant monetary award that Jenner received. When Jesty died in 1816, his wife made certain that his tombstone recorded for all posterity his central role in the great endeavor (see frontispiece).",79,Jesty,Jesty,1.0
"Despite Jesty’s successful vaccination of his family, Jenner’s work with cowpox vaccination still holds title to the first sci- entific attempt to control an infectious disease on a large scale by means other than transmitting the disease itself.29",79,Jesty,Jesty,1.0
"Cowpox was not a widespread infection. It appeared spo- radically in certain rural counties of England. Thus, the local wisdom that persons who contracted cowpox “did not take the smallpox” was not widely known. Jenner knew it because he had been an apothecary apprentice in Chipping Sodbury in 1768, where a milkmaid told him about using cowpox against smallpox. Indeed, he discussed the possible associa- tion between the two with John Hunter, with whom he studied in London from 1770 to 1773. For unknown reasons, Jenner did not return to the subject of cowpox/smallpox until 1796. His first manuscript to the Royal Society on vaccination was rejected because his experiment involved only one person, not enough to establish a principle.20,27 Within 2 years, he expanded his studies and proved that cowpox could be passed directly from one person to another, thereby providing “large-scale” inoculation against smallpox without depending on the spo- radic outbreaks of natural cowpox. Jenner self-published his results in Variolae Vaccinae in 1798.29 This publication brought to the attention of the entire medical community the merits of inoculation with the relatively obscure animal disease, cowpox, to prevent one of humankind’s deadliest scourges. Fortunately for the world, Jenner had the connections that Jesty did not, and vaccination rapidly replaced variolation. While Jenner did use the term “vaccine,” he is not the origina- tor of the term vaccination; that honor belongs to his friend Richard Dunning, who used it in 1800.30,31 By 1810, Jenner realized that immunity against smallpox by vaccination was not lifelong, but he did not know why.13",78,Smallpox,Smallpox – Cowpox,1.0
"Curiously, the vaccinia virus used in current smallpox",0,Smallpox,Smallpox – Variolation,0.8864532489453774
"vaccine is not the cowpox virus that Jenner used. Vaccinia, cowpox, and variola are all related orthopox viruses, suspected to have been derived from a common ancestor.32 S. Monkton Copeman33–35 gave considerable attention to this issue in the Milroy Lectures of 1898, which make fascinating reading. He documents the many ways, times, and methods by which cows were inoculated to keep the supply of cowpox intact, further adding to the confusion of when and how vaccinia replaced cowpox.33–35 It has been suggested that vaccinia may have originated in a now extinct horsepox.36 What is clear is that",81,Vaccinia,Vaccinia – Horsepox,1.0

"For the first several decades of the 19th century, arm-to-arm transfer was the primary method of human vaccination.37 Other recognized diseases, such as syphilis and tuberculosis, were known to be occasionally transmitted along with the “cowpox” virus, so a search was underway to find an alterna- tive way to vaccinate and to ensure a steady supply of cowpox vaccine. The concept of “passages” of the immunizing agent (transmission from one human or animal to another) was well known, and in 1836, Edward Ballard38 argued for choos- ing new strains of cowpox for vaccination because the old strains were too weak (too attenuated) from so many arm-to- arm passages. He recommended that the lymph (vesicle fluid) be passed back through a calf to regain strength.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"According to Ballard, the idea to use animals to propagate cowpox vaccine, as opposed to human arm-to-arm propaga- tion, was first practiced in Naples, Italy, in 1805. Troja used vaccine virus derived from humans to inoculate cows and then used the lymph from the cows’ pocks to vaccinate humans. This was referred to as retrovaccination. Troja’s successor, Gal- biati, stated that he used bovine lymph specifically to avoid transmission of other human diseases. By 1842, a third Italian, Negri, gave up the practice of retrovaccination entirely. He started what was called animal vaccination, that is, inoculating from one cow to another cow to keep a steady supply of cowpox lymph. But the initial virus source that he inoculated into the cow was from a human! When a natural outbreak of cowpox occurred in Calabria, Negri switched to that source for his lymph, but because he was running a commercial activity, he bought a third “cowpox strain” from London. Its origin was questionable, but Negri used it anyway, from 1858 onward. By mid- century, arm-to-arm vaccination was essen- tially replaced by animal vaccination but it is easy to under- stand why the origin of the vaccinia virus is difficult to trace.35,38 In 1864, a French physician named Lanoix studied animal vaccination in Naples and brought back to France a calf inocu- lated by Negri. He and Chambon set up a business in France for production of calf-to-calf lymph vaccine for humans.15,35,38 Subsequently, the French government became interested and ordered a study of animal vaccination. The lymph used in the experiments was obtained from Negri in Italy, but was really from the London cowpox lymph of questionable origin. By chance, there were two outbreaks of cowpox in France in 1866. Lanoix and Chambon collected cowpox from both, mixed them together, and used the mixture to produce their vaccine.35,38 From these confused beginnings, animal vaccina-",81,Vaccinia,Vaccinia – Horsepox,1.0

"Following Robert Koch’s recommendation, German scien- tists began to use glycerin to kill bacteria and to preserve the lymph.39 This generated a ready supply of a stable calf lymph of consistent potency.13 By the end of the 1890s, the use of glycerinated calves’ lymph was standard everywhere, and both arm-to-arm vaccination and unglycerinated animal vaccina- tion were abandoned.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
Louis Pasteur and the Age of Vaccination,89,Vaccination,Vaccination – Louis,1.0
"Louis Pasteur’s (Fig. 1.2) work on the attenuation of the chicken cholera bacterium in the late 1870s was the first major advance after Jenner’s Variolae Vaccinae. Pasteur drew on con- cepts that had been developing for at least 40 years: attenua- tion; modification through passage; renewed virulence; and, most important, the need to replace person-to-person (or animal-to-animal) vaccination with something safer, consis- tent, and less likely to transmit other diseases.40",32,Cholera,Cholera – Vaccination,1.0
The popular story that Pasteur had a “eureka” moment when he noticed that a chicken cholera culture (Pasteurella,32,Cholera,Cholera – Vaccination,0.6070501609592818

"multocida) left exposed to air during a long holiday period provided immunity when challenged is considerably more complex than originally told. From the moment he obtained the chicken cholera culture from Henry Toussaint in October 1878, Pasteur spoke of wanting to manipulate it to make a vaccine. The culture was virulent, and he killed many chickens trying to keep it alive through passage from chicken to chicken. By January 1879, he found that he could keep the microbe alive in a culture of chicken bouillon. Chickens inoculated from this bouillon culture died, so it had retained the viru- lence of his original sample. Next, he prepared a bouillon culture using inflamed chicken muscle tissue from the site of inoculation. He noted that this infected muscle tissue culture did not develop normally as the other cultures did; it became acidic. He fed the chickens bread soaked in the first bouillon culture and then fed them bread soaked in the muscle bouil- lon. They became sick but survived. He then challenged them with virulent organisms and they lived, so he thought he had a vaccine. After the challenge, the chickens sickened again but again survived and eventually returned to health. So by March 1879, Pasteur realized that he had attained “resistance” to disease; he also knew he had not yet found a product that could be safely used as a vaccine. For the next several months, Pasteur subjected the chicken cholera microbe to various con- ditions, for example, in a vacuum, exposed to air, and various intervals before inoculation. But it was mainly the chickens that had eaten the bread soaked in acidic bouillon that survived.",32,Cholera,Cholera – Vaccination,0.9679288516941851
Pasteur left on vacation at the end of July 1879; he returned,83,Pasteur,Pasteur,1.0
"in October and again took up his chicken cholera experiments, focusing on the cultures that had become acidic because they seemed to be the ones that conferred immunity. He tinkered with the amount of time the microbe remained in the acidic cultures. On December 18, 1879, he noted that two cultures made from a chicken that died of a pre-vacation inoculation were the only cultures that turned acidic. He focused on them for his vaccine, although he still had many problems with illness in the chickens. By the middle of January 1880, Pasteur realized that the diminution of virulence came from leaving the microbe for a long time in an acid culture.",32,Cholera,Cholera – Vaccination,1.0
"Pasteur’s definitive test was on January 22, 1880. With highly virulent chicken cholera, he inoculated 19 naïve chick- ens and 8 that had been previously immunized twice with his acidic cultures. All eight of the previously immunized chickens lived. Most of the naïve candidates did not. So Pasteur’s eureka moment was really the result of many months of intensive, deliberate research. Pasteur presented his results at the Acadé- mie des Sciences on February 8, 1880, and at the Académie de Médicine on February 10, 1880. He announced that he had achieved successful vaccination against chicken cholera, but he did not reveal his technique. He continued to refine his technique and tried to increase the stability of the final product. Finally, in October 1880, he published at least part of his method for preparation of the vaccine.20,41 Pasteur’s chicken cholera vaccine harkened back to the classic variola- tion technique, which had used a weakened form of smallpox to inoculate against smallpox. Therefore, the modern concept of vaccination, involving the development of vaccines in the laboratory and using the same agent that caused the disease, was truly introduced with Pasteur’s chicken cholera vaccine, 5 years before the famous vaccination of Joseph Meister against rabies. Ironically, the chicken cholera vaccine was never a success; there were frequent vaccine failures. Pasteur was lauded, but the vaccine was eventually discontinued.20",32,Cholera,Cholera – Vaccination,0.8452909625259383

Toussaint used the blood of bovines that had died of anthrax, noting that the fluid was full of bacteria, which others thought was extraneous material but Toussaint thought was the causative agent of anthrax. He first attempted to simply “filter” the blood and use it as a vaccine but quickly realized that the bacteria could pass through the filter. He then decided to follow the procedure that Davaine described: to heat the blood for 10 minutes at 55°C or subject the blood to the action of diluted phenol. He used both of these techniques—and a variation on filtering in which he used 12 filters—to produce an attenuated vaccine that he injected in rabbits, sheep, and young dogs. The animals were protected by all three methods, although Toussaint initially thought that the heat-treated was the best.",15,Anthrax,Anthrax – Vaccine,0.7605469252943319

"Pasteur and others challenged their validity and Toussaint was compelled to not only reveal his methods, but also to conduct experiments to prove his claim. On July 28, while still in Toulouse, he took fresh blood from a sheep dying of anthrax and prepared his vaccine in two lots, one with 1% phenol and the other with 1.5%. Both lots were filtered, although by dif- ferent means. Neither lot was heat-treated. He left for Paris with his two lots of “vaccine,” where his experiment continued at Vincennes and Alfort under the watchful eyes of several researchers. On August 8, Toussaint inoculated 20 sheep with the first solution (1% and filter papers); 4 of them died very quickly, but the other 16 survived. On August 22, six new sheep were inoculated with material from the second lot (1.5% phenol and rudimentary filtration), and all survived without illness. All 22 sheep were then subjected to challenge with virulent anthrax and all survived. With one injection of a (partially) live vaccine attenuated by filtration and phenol acid, Toussaint had achieved immunity to anthrax!20",15,Anthrax,Anthrax – Vaccine,0.7103838922125131
It should be reemphasized that Pasteur did not reveal the,83,Pasteur,Pasteur,1.0

He indeed induced immunity to anthrax, and his was the first anthrax vaccine. Eventually, he received the Prix Vaillant and the Légion d’Honneur for this work.20,46–49 Toussaint came down with a debilitating neurologic disease in 1881, which prevented him from pursuing his claim as the originator of the first anthrax vaccine.

Pasteur inoculated 24 sheep, 1 goat, and 6 cows with attenuated anthrax bacilli. On May 17, these same animals were inoculated again with more virulent but still attenuated anthrax bacilli. At the same time, 24 sheep, 1 goat, and 4 cows were kept as control animals and given no inocula- tions.

"By the time the rabies vaccine was first administered to humans in 1885,54 the general public and the scientific com- munity were well aware of the “new vaccination,” but only in relation to animals. The reaction when Joseph Meister and Jean Baptiste Jupille became the first humans to be vaccinated against rabies was predictable: outrage. Meister, a 9-year-old boy from Alsace, had been bitten 14 times on the hands and thighs and arrived in Paris some 60 hours after he had been attacked by a rabid dog. The physician working with Pasteur, Dr. Joseph Grancher, was convinced that Meister would die of rabies if left untreated and, therefore, the attempt to vaccinate was justified to save his life. Meister was vaccinated in the same manner that Pasteur was using in his experiments to protect animals (especially dogs) against rabies: with a series of pro- gressively less dried and, therefore, more virulent rabbit spinal cords obtained from rabbits that had died of rabies after having received “fixed virus” injections of rabies virus. A couple of months later, Jean Baptiste Jupille, a 14-year-old from the Jura region of France, arrived 6 days after having been bitten multiple times. (He had fought off a rabid dog that had attacked a number of younger children.) He was given the same course of treatment that Meister received. They both survived.13",42,Rabies,Rabies – Vaccinated,0.9351303615431945
That Pasteur had deliberately introduced a deadly agent,83,Pasteur,Pasteur,1.0
"into a human left people aghast. The fact that the rabies virus had been attenuated did not appease the general public or many in the medical community; the cases of rabies that occasionally occurred in subsequent vaccinees were attributed to the vaccine and were viewed as medical murders. Even Émile Roux, one of Pasteur’s staunchest allies and a collabora- tor in the rabies experiments, was appalled at the vaccination of Meister. He thought it was unjustified by the experiments conducted up to that point.",42,Rabies,Rabies – Vaccinated,0.8864474884865465
"An examination of Pasteur’s laboratory notebooks indi- cates that Roux was right to object.52 The notebooks tell us that, shortly before vaccinating Meister, in May and June of that same year, Pasteur had seen and recommended vaccina- tion for two other people in local hospitals, each of whom had been admitted with the presumed diagnosis of rabies. The first, an adult, was admitted with an uncertain diagnosis of rabies. The second case was a young girl, 11 years old, who had been bitten by a rabid dog on the lip, remained untreated, and was admitted to a hospital a month later with frank rabies. In both cases, Pasteur used a rabies vaccine made of an emulsion of dessicated spinal cord from a rabid rabbit. Up to this point, he had never published anything about using spinal cords as a vaccine, and in fact, had not yet successfully protected any animal from rabies with such a vaccine. The first patient, the adult whose diagnosis was uncertain, received only one–unauthorized–dose of the vaccine before his doctor forbade the administration of further doses. This patient lived. The young girl, whose rabies diagnosis was not in doubt,",42,Rabies,Rabies – Vaccinated,1.0
"received two injections of the same vaccine on her first day in the hospital. When Pasteur and his nephew Adrian Loir arrived the next morning to give the third injection, the young girl died before she could receive it.52 The death was almost cer- tainly from rabies and not from the two injections she had received. These two cases were never published by Pasteur but were subsequently found in his laboratory notebooks.",42,Rabies,Rabies – Vaccinated,1.0
"Roux left Pasteur’s laboratory in protest after Meister’s vac- cination and did not return until the summer of 1886, after several dozen people who had been bitten by rabid animals had been successfully vaccinated.13,52,55,56 Ultimately, hundreds were saved from rabies, many more than had died despite the vaccination (presumably from rabies contracted from the bites). Unfortunately, that did not lessen the strenuous oppo- sition to rabies vaccination in humans nor the belief by many that the vaccination itself caused the deaths. After all, only 45 years earlier, once Jenner’s vaccination had been accepted, variolation had been made a felony in England for the very same reason: it introduced a deadly live virus into humans (as opposed to cowpox, which was not deadly).13 Grancher, the physician who administered the rabies vaccine to Meister and many others, was one of Pasteur’s staunchest supporters and was invaluable in defending Pasteur before the Académie de Médicine and against recalcitrant physicians.56 Despite the opposition, and thanks to Grancher and other supporters, Pasteur soon became a worldwide medical hero.",42,Rabies,Rabies – Vaccinated,0.6068054206032367

In 1888, Salmon read a paper before the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) defending their 1886 article and their priority in developing the first killed vaccine.61 However, the Institut Pasteur had just been established in 1887; Pasteur was at the height of his fame and worldwide prestige thanks to the rabies vaccine. Not surpris- ingly, Salmon and Smith, working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, saw their claim lost in the aura surrounding Pasteur and his associates. Thus, even 100 years ago, the Insti- tut Pasteur and the U.S. government were involved in disputa- tions about discovery rights, similar to the late 20th-century controversy about who first isolated the human immune defi- ciency virus: Luc Montagnier at the Institut Pasteur or Robert Gallo at the National Institutes of Health.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0

He switched to studies of plague immunization and was himself the first to be injected with his new killed plague vaccine. More than 8000 people were then vaccinated within a few weeks. For a while, Haffkine was a hero. However, the Mulkowal incident in 1902 when 19 people died from contaminated plague vaccine resulted in Haffkine’s removal from his post by the Indian government. The contamination (with tetanus bacillus) does not seem to have been his fault.15 Nevertheless, his scientific career and reputation were severely damaged; he never fully recovered from the incident and retired early from science at age 55 years. Later, with the wisdom of hindsight, the Indian government renamed the Plague Research Laboratory where he had worked The Haffkine Institute. Perhaps as important as his development of the plague vaccine was Haffkine’s contribution to the literature on the proper way to conduct controlled field trials.72",85,Cholera,Cholera – Plague,1.0

Further experiments showed that the anti- toxin protected animals challenged with the tetanus or diph- theria bacillus.

"At the beginning of the 20th century, five human vaccines were in use: Jenner’s original smallpox vaccine and Pasteur’s rabies vaccine (both containing live virus) and three bacterial vac- cines: typhoid, cholera, and plague (all killed). In addition, immunization with diphtheria or tetanus antitoxin was an accepted practice. The 19th century’s end also saw the end of arm-to-arm lymph inoculation as a vehicle for smallpox vac- cination. This technique was replaced by the use of glycerin- ated calf lymph in 1898.13 Most of the fundamental concepts of vaccinology had been introduced by the end of the 19th century; the early 20th century would bring refinements to these theoretical underpinnings.

"Wright proposed mass immunization of British troops with killed typhoid vaccine during the Boer War (1899), but there was opposition because of adverse reactions and he was able to vaccinate only 14,000 volunteers. Opposition ran so high that consignments of vaccine were dumped overboard from transport ships in Southampton. The result was catastrophic: more than 58,000 cases of typhoid and 9000 deaths in the British Army.63 A bitter battle about the merits of the vaccine was waged in the British Medical Journal between Wright and the statistician Karl Pearson. Ultimately, at Wright’s insistence, the War Board initiated a broad-based trial that showed the overwhelming effectiveness of the vaccine. Wright was then knighted. By the beginning of World War I in 1914, general typhoid vaccination was conducted in the British Army, although it was still not mandatory.63,85,86",50,Typhoid,Typhoid – Vaccines – T50,1.0

Sometimes they were combined with immune serum to become “serobacterins”— the serum would provide short-term immunity before the killed bacterial antigens kicked in to provide long-term immu- nity. The concept was an outgrowth of Metchnikoff’s theory of phagocytosis and Wright’s work on opsonins. It was thought that bacterins worked because opsonins induced by the anti- gens prepared invading bacteria for phagocytosis. Most bac- terins were prepared and sold without clinical trials. In its 1908 catalog, HK Mulford Company, a forerunner to Merck, listed nine bacterins that it sold, including those for gonor- rhea, typhoid, pneumococcal disease, and streptococcal disease.

The residual formalin in the vats rendered the batch of toxin so weak that 1000 times the normal dose did not kill the guinea pigs. Although this toxoid was certainly safer than the toxin, it could be administered only in conjunction with antitoxin. In that same year, Gaston Ramon developed a diphtheria toxoid that could be used on its own (i.e., without antitoxin) by adding formalin and incubating the mixture at 37°C for several weeks.91 Ramon and Christian Zoeller used a tetanus toxoid developed in the same manner for the first human vaccinations against tetanus in 1926.92,93",7,Diphtheria,Diphtheria,0.8013272780355417

Calmette was a protégé of Emile Roux and founder of the Pasteur Institutes at Lille and in Indochina.13 In 1906, Calmette and Camille Guérin, a veterinarian, started subculturing a strain of mycobacteria obtained from a bovine, which they perhaps thought was Mycobacterium tuberculosis but was in reality Mycobacterium bovis. They originally focused on producing a serotherapy, along the lines of von Behring’s antidiphtheria serotherapy, but quickly realized they could not inhibit the pathogenicity of the bacillus very easily. That began their pursuit of a vaccine. After 13 years of attenuation by 230 passages in beef bile, potatoes, and glycerol, this strain eventually became the BCG strain. In total, Calmette and Guérin spent more than 20 years trying to understand the mechanism of infection of tubercu- losis.94 Clinical trials in children began in 1921, and the vaccine became available for human use in 1927.13,95–99 Because the original vaccine strain was sent to numerous laboratories around the world, each of which then produced its own varia- tion of BCG vaccine, standardization has proved difficult.

After using tissue cultures of the Maitland type (substituting monkey kidney for Maitland’s rabbit kidney), they tried to grow viruses in explanted human cells, using fibroblasts grown from the foreskin and muscle tissue of infants who had died soon after birth. Their first success was to grow Lansing type II poliovirus in human cell culture.142 The ability to grow human viruses in vitro, in a relatively easy and safe manner in monolayer cell cultures, led to an veritable explosion of creativity in vaccinology that continues unabated (see Table 1.1). Indeed, Enders, Weller, and Robbins received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1954 for their seminal work.

The majority of Salk’s research on killed polio vaccine and the large clinical trial in 1954 (more than 1.8 million children) were funded by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (March of Dimes), founded by Franklin Roosevelt in 1938 and directed by Basil O’Connor. The Foun- dation’s idea on the trial design did not include a placebo- control; on the contrary, Francis insisted on the need for placebo-control. After a shaky start, the clinical trial was designed by a committee that included both points of view, headed by Thomas Francis, Salk’s former mentor, who ulti- mately directed the trial. Although Salk wanted every child in the trial to receive his vaccine, Francis stood his ground and insisted on use of a placebo. The controversial trial design was called a “dual-control” trial. In 11 states, children in grades 1 through 3 received injections of either the polio vaccine or a placebo. In 33 other states, children in grade 2 received injec- tions of the vaccine and all children from grades 1 through 3 were “observed” for the duration of the polio season.

"Personal protection, spraying, and antibiotics380–383 did not stem the rising tide of Lyme infection. Two vaccine candidates were put into extensive clinical trials.384–388 Each was based on a recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing the gene for outer surface protein A (OspA) of the American Lyme strain.375 An OspA vaccine was approved by the FDA in 1999 and rec- ommended for use in persons 15 to 70 years old who lived or worked in endemic areas of infection.377",63,Burgdorferi,Burgdorferi,1.0
"Despite the extensive clinical trials and postlicensure sur- veillance, the vaccine was not well accepted because of a tepid recommendation from the CDC, the alternative of antibiotic treatment after infection, and the need for booster doses. Equally important, a series of class action and individual law- suits was brought against the manufacturer claiming that the vaccine caused chronic arthritis and other autoimmune prob- lems, although the evidence for vaccine-induced arthritis is absent.376 In April 2002, the vaccine was withdrawn from the market owing to lack of demand.389",4,Vaccine,Vaccine – Pertussis,0.36241382799027977
"A recombinant, quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was licensed in the United States in 2006, a landmark event because it represents the second vaccine against a human cancer (hepatitis B vaccine being the first) because it is 95% effective in preventing liver cancer caused by hepatitis B infection. The research to develop the HPV vaccine spanned at least 15 years, two continents, several laboratories, and competing claims of priority. The subunit vaccine is based on the capability of self-assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) in the L1 (major) capsid protein, which is synthesized in yeast. Using HPV-16, an Australian group under Ian Frazer pub- lished data in 1991 showing the synthesis of L1 and L2 genes and the production of VLPs, but only when both L1 and L2 were synthesized together.390 They recognized that these VLPs could be a potential source material for a vaccine. One year later, John Schiller, Douglas Lowy, and others, at the National Cancer Institute, using a bovine model, established that the L1 capsid protein gene could self-assemble without the need for L2 and produced very high neutralizing antibodies.391 In effect, the L1 protein made itself into a structure that mim-",10,Papillomavirus,Papillomavirus,0.4574363986872769

"In 1993, Schiller’s group showed that HPV L1 produced in baculovirus was more efficient at self-assembly than the HPV L1 mutant that had been used by Frazer.392 Laboratories from Georgetown University and Rochester University also made significant contributions to the science underlying this vaccine.393,394 A concise summary of these various threads has been published by the National Cancer Institute.395 One HPV vaccine contains VLPs of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The type 16 and 18 serotypes are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers in the United States. A second, bivalent HPV vaccine was licensed in the United States in 2009. The quadrivalent vaccine is also effective against genital warts, whereas the bivalent targets only cervical cancer.",10,Papillomavirus,Papillomavirus,0.14906150622287476

"The use of proteins, polysaccharides, and recombinant technology broadened the possibilities for vaccine develop- ment immensely but challenges remained. Some diseases, such as N. meningitidis serogroup B had eluded vaccine devel- opment via traditional methods, though not for lack of trying. Meningococcus serogroup B did not have readily obvious pro- tective proteins, polysaccharides or antigens. Its capsular poly- saccharide was only weakly immunogenic and was thought to cause an autoimmune response.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"In 1995 the first complete genome sequence was pub- lished (H. influenzae) and it immediately changed the game in vaccine research.396 In the decade that followed, more than 100 other pathogen sequences were completed and hundreds more undertaken. DNA microarray of these genomes allows for vastly more rapid identification of proteins that could be possible vaccine candidates.397",48,Vaccine,Vaccine – Genome,0.9174156001734423
"Meningococcus serogroup B is the first disease where genome sequencing has been successful in identifying such vaccine candidates. This was accomplished with reverse vac- cinology, a technology first pioneered by Rino Rappuoli and colleagues in Siena.398,399 As the MC58 strain of meningococ- cus serogroup B was being sequenced, a computer program was used to predict 600 specific antigens as possible vaccine candidates. Of the 600 antigens, 350 (58%) proved workable and 28 (5%) ultimately induced bactericidal antibodies. The technique identified more viable candidates for a meningo- coccal serogroup B vaccine than had been considered or tested in the preceding 40 years.397,400",47,Meningococcal,Meningococcal – Meningococcus,0.06731291530769716
"DNA array analysis and reverse vaccinology have been further aided by the introduction of proteomics which allows the identification of subsets of all proteins that are present at any particular point in the life of the bacteria, thus further shortening the time to finding viable vaccine candidates.397",48,Vaccine,Vaccine – Genome,1.0

"The majority of vaccines now being developed use new technologies that seem to offer greater safety and more pos- sibilities. The focus on subunit (purified protein or polysac- charide), genetically engineered, or vectored antigens has been greatly enlarged by the addition of powerful new techniques such as DNA array analysis, reverse genetics and proteomics. However, older, classic methods such as attenuation and inac- tivation of whole virus continue to yield new vaccines, as the zoster vaccine demonstrates.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"As we continue in the second decade of the 21st century, the prospect for vaccines is stellar. Since 2000, 13 important vaccines have been licensed in the United States and Europe: a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (2000); a cold-adapted influenza vaccine (2003); a meningococcal quadrivalent conjugated polysaccharide vaccine (2005); a high-potency zoster vaccine (2006); the quadrivalent HPV VLP vaccine (2006); a pentavalent rotavirus reassortant vaccine (2006); an attenuated human strain rotavirus vaccine (2008), a second-generation, Vero-cell–produced, inactivated JE vaccine (2009); a bivalent HPV vaccine (2009); a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (2010); a nine-valent HPV vaccine (2014); and, at long last, two meningococcal sero- group B vaccines (2014, 2015).
