"To generate vaccine-mediated protection is a complex chal- lenge. Currently available vaccines have largely been devel- oped empirically, with little or no understanding of how they activate the immune system. Their early protective efficacy is primarily conferred by the induction of antigen-specific anti- bodies (Box 2.1). However, there is more to antibody- mediated protection than the peak of vaccine-induced antibody titers. The quality of such antibodies (e.g., their avidity, specificity, or neutralizing capacity) has been identi- fied as a determining factor in efficacy. Long-term protection requires the persistence of vaccine antibodies above protective thresholds and/or the maintenance of immune memory cells capable of rapid and effective reactivation with subsequent microbial exposure. The determinants of immune memory induction, as well as the relative contribution of persisting antibodies and of immune memory to protection against spe- cific diseases, are essential parameters of long-term vaccine efficacy.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"New methods have emerged allowing the assessment of a growing number of vaccine-associated immune parameters, including in humans. This development raises new questions about the optimal markers to assess and their correlation with vaccine-induced protection. The identification of mechanistic immune correlates—or at least surrogates—of vaccine efficacy is a major asset for the development of new vaccines or the optimization of immunization strategies using available vac- cines. Thus, their determination generates a considerable amount of interest. During the last decade, the increased awareness of the complexity of the immune system and its determinants, including at the host genetic level, indicated that using system biology approaches to assess how various processes and networks interact in response to immunization could prove more illustrative than trying to isolate and char- acterize a few components of vaccine responses.1 Delineating the specific molecular signatures of vaccine immunogenicity is beginning to highlight novel correlates of protective immu- nity and better explain the heterogeneity of vaccine responses in a population. The tailoring of vaccine strategies for specific vulnerable populations, including very young, elderly, and immunosuppressed populations, also largely relies on a better understanding of what supports or limits vaccine efficacy under special circumstances—at the population and individ- ual levels. Lastly, the exponential development of new vaccines raises many questions that are not limited to the targeted diseases and the potential impacts of their prevention, but that address the specific and nonspecific impacts of such vaccines on the immune system and, thus, on health in general. These immune-related concerns have largely spread into the population, and questions related to the immunological safety of vaccines—that is, their capacity for triggering",28,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunosuppressed,1.0

HOW DO VACCINES MEDIATE PROTECTION?,-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0
"Vaccines protect by inducing effector mechanisms (cells or molecules) capable of rapidly controlling replicating patho- gens or inactivating their toxic components. Vaccine-induced immune effectors (Table 2.1) are essentially antibodies— produced by B lymphocytes—capable of binding specifically to a toxin or a pathogen.2 Other potential effectors are cyto- toxic CD8+ T lymphocytes that may limit the spread of infec- tious agents by recognizing and killing infected cells or secreting specific antiviral cytokines and CD4+ T-helper (Th) lymphocytes. These Th cells may contribute to protection through cytokine production and provide support to the gen- eration and maintenance of B and CD8+ T-cell responses. Effector CD4+ Th cells were initially subdivided into T-helper 1 (Th1) or T-helper 2 (Th2) subsets depending on their main cytokine production (interferon-γ or interleukin [IL]-4), respectively. This dichotomy became outdated as Th cells were increasingly shown to include a large number of subsets with distinct cytokine-producing and homing capacities (see Table 2.1).3 A recently identified critical subset of vaccine-induced CD4+ Th cells are follicular T-helper (Tfh) cells: they are spe- cially equipped and positioned in the lymph nodes to support potent B-cell activation and differentiation into antibody- secreting-cells4 and were identified as directly controlling anti- body responses and mediating adjuvanticity.5–7 Another important subset are T-helper 17 (Th17) cells which essen- tially defend against extracellular bacteria that colonize the skin and mucosa, recruiting neutrophils and promoting local inflammation.8,9 These effectors are controlled by regulatory T cells (Tregs) involved in maintaining immune tolerance.10 Most antigens and vaccines trigger B- and T-cell responses, such that there is no rationale in opposing vaccines favoring antibody production (“humoral immunity”) and T-cell responses (“cellular immunity”). In addition, CD4+ T cells are required for most antibody responses, whereas antibodies exert significant influences on T-cell responses to intracellular pathogens.11",50,Cytokines,Cytokines – Vaccines,1.0

"Antigen-specific antibodies have been formally demon- strated as conferring vaccine-induced protection against many diseases19 (see Table 2.2). Passive protection may result from the physiological transfer of maternal antibodies (e.g., tetanus) or the passive administration of immunoglobulins or vaccine- induced hyperimmune serum (e.g., measles, hepatitis, vari- cella). Such antibodies may neutralize toxins in the periphery, at their site of production in an infected wound (tetanus), or in the throat (diphtheria). They may reduce binding or adhe- sion to susceptible cells or receptors and limit viral replication (e.g., polio) or reduce bacterial colonization (glycoconjugate vaccines against encapsulated bacteria) if present at suffi- ciently high titers on mucosal surfaces.20 The neutralization of pathogens at mucosal surfaces is mainly achieved by the transudation of vaccine-induced serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies.

"Under certain circumstances, however, passive antibody- mediated immunity is inefficient (tuberculosis). There is con- clusive evidence that T cells are the main effectors of BCG, even though specific T-cell frequency and cytokine expression profiles do not correlate with protection in BCG-immunized infants,15,22 or in zoster immunized adults.23,24 However, there is indirect evidence that vaccine-induced T cells contribute to the protection conferred by other vaccines. CD4+ T cells seem to support the persistence of protection against clinical pertus- sis in children primed in infancy, after vaccine-induced anti- bodies have waned,25–28 and may contribute to the longer vaccine efficacy of whole-cell pertussis vaccines.29–31 Another example is that of measles immunization in 6-month-old infants in whom antibody responses largely are not initiated because of immune immaturity and/or the residual presence of inhibitory maternal antibodies, but significant interferon (IFN)-γ–producing CD4+ T cells are generated.32,33 The infants remain susceptible to measles infection but are protected against severe disease and death, presumably because of the viral clearance capacity of their vaccine-induced T-cell effec- tors. Thus, prevention of infection may be achieved only by vaccine-induced antibodies, whereas disease attenuation and protection against complications may be supported by T cells, even in the absence of specific antibodies.

"Novel adjuvants essentially enhance vaccine responses by modulating innate immunity, which shapes adaptive responses.34–38 Indeed, the induction of antigen-specific B- and T-cell responses requires their activation in the draining lymph nodes by specific antigen-presenting cells (APCs), essentially dendritic cells (DCs) that must be recruited into the reaction. Immature DCs patrol throughout the body. When exposed to pathogens in the tissues or at the site of injection, they undergo brisk maturation, modulate specific surface receptors, and migrate toward secondary lymph nodes, where the induction of T- and B-cell responses occurs. The central role for mature DCs in the induction of vaccine responses reflects their unique capacity to provide antigen-specific, costimulation signals to T cells; these “danger signals” are required to activate naïve T cells.39 The very first requirement to elicit vaccine responses is to provide sufficient “danger signals” through vaccine antigens and/or adjuvants (Fig. 2.1) to trigger an inflammatory reaction that is mediated by cells of the innate immune system.34–37",54,Vaccines,Vaccines – Dendritic,1.0

In the absence of danger signals, DCs remain immature: On contact with naïve T cells, T cells do not differentiate into immune effectors but into regulatory CD4+ T cells that maintain immune tolerance.10",53,Neutrophils,Neutrophils,0.6812608833253752
"Live viral vaccines most efficiently trigger the activation of the innate immune system through multiple pathogen- associated signals (such as viral RNA), allowing their recognition by pattern-recognition receptors (see Table 2.3).41 Following injection, viral particles rapidly disseminate throughout the vascular network and reach their target tissues. This pattern is very similar to that occurring after a natural infection, including the initial mucosal replication stage for vaccines administered through the nasal and oral routes. DCs are activated at multiple sites, migrate toward the correspond- ing draining lymph nodes, and launch multiple foci of T- and B-cell activation. This sequence provides a second explanation of the generally higher immunogenicity of live versus “nonlive” vaccines (Table 2.4).42 Another consequence of this early dif- fusion pattern is that the site and route of injection of live viral vaccines are of minor importance; for example, the immuno- genicity and reactogenicity of measles vaccine is similar fol- lowing intramuscular or subcutaneous injection,43 and measles vaccine may be administered by aerosol.

"glycoconjugates, or inactivated microorganisms (see Table 2.2), may still contain pathogen-recognition patterns. In the absence of microbial replication, however, vaccine-induced activation remains more limited, in both time and space. Nonlive vaccines essentially activate innate responses at their site of injection (see Fig. 2.1). Their site and route of admin- istration are, thus, more important. The high number of DCs in the dermis allows a marked reduction (e.g., 10-fold) of the antigen dose with intradermal immunization. This advantage of the dermal DC concentration is applied to the prevention of rabies in many countries and could prove useful against additional targets as novel microneedle and needle-free devices become available for intradermal administration.44 Patrolling DCs are also numerous in well-vascularized muscles, which is the preferred route of injection for nonlive vaccines. They are fewer in adipose tissues, such that subcutaneous injections may be less effective than intramuscular injections under conditions of limited immunogenicity, as demonstrated for adult immunization against hepatitis B.45 Despite many efforts, immunization through the mucosal route remains limited to a few live vaccines. The extreme difficulty in produc- ing nonlive mucosal vaccines reflects the need to overcome a large number of physical, immunological, and chemical bar- riers, which requires the use of live vaccines or strong adju- vants.

"B cells are essentially activated in the lymph nodes draining the injection site. Vaccine antigens reaching the subcapsular sinus by free-fluid diffusion are taken up by specific subcap- sular sinus macrophages and translocated into the B-cell zone. The B cells equipped with surface B-cell receptors49 capable of binding to the vaccine antigens are activated and migrate to the interface between the B-cell (follicle) and the T-cell zones. There, B cells engage T cells and initiate their proliferation. The cumulative amount of costimulation signals received by B cells determines their fate.50 Protein antigens (which are taken up and displayed as small peptides on the surface of APCs) activate Tfh cells. This induces a highly efficient B-cell differentiation pathway, through specific structures (germinal centers [GCs]) in which antigen-specific B cells proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells or memory B cells.51 Polysaccharide antigens that fail to recruit Tfh cells into the response do not trigger GCs, such that they elicit only short-lived plasma cells resulting in weaker and less durable antibody responses with no immune memory.",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"Ig class-switch recombination from IgM toward IgG, IgA, or IgE occurs during this differentiation of B cells, through the upregulation of the activation-induced deaminase enzyme. Both CD4+ Th1 and Th2 cells exert essential helper functions during the extrafollicular differentiation pathway, and the engagement of their CD40L molecules with CD40 on B cells may skew class-switch recombination into particular Ig classes and subclasses. In rodents, IFN-γ–producing Th1 T cells promote a switch toward IgG2a, whereas Th2 cells essentially support the generation of IgG1 and IgE (via IL-4) and IgG2b and IgG3 (via transforming growth factor [TGF]-β).54 The situ- ation is less clear-cut in humans, where IgG1 antibodies fre- quently predominate regardless of the polarization of T-cell help. The extrafollicular reaction is rapid, and IgM and low- level IgG antibodies appear in the blood a few days after primary immunization (see Figs. 2.2 and 2.3). These antibod- ies are of germline affinity, as there is no hypermutation or selection process during the extrafollicular reaction.

"The Germinal Center Reaction. Antigen-specific B cells that receive sufficient help from antigen-specific activated Tfh cells proliferate in specialized structures, the GCs, in which they differentiate into plasma cells or memory B cells.50,55 The induction of GCs is initiated as a few antigen-specific activated B cells upregulate their expression of CXCR5 and migrate toward B-cell follicles, where they are attracted by CXCL13- expressing follicular DCs (FDCs). The FDCs fulfill an essential role in B-cell responses: they attract antigen-specific B and Tfh cells and capture/retain antigen for extended periods. B cells attracted by antigen-bearing FDCs become the founders of GCs (see Fig. 2.2). Receiving additional activation and survival signals from the FDCs and Tfh cells,56,57 notably through IL-21,58 B cells undergo massive clonal proliferation—such that each GC is constituted by the progeny of a single antigen- specific B cell. This intense proliferation is associated with two major events: Ig class-switch recombination from IgM toward IgG, IgA, or IgE, and maturation of the affinity of B cells for their specific antigen.

This enables these B cells to efficiently compete for binding to the small amounts of vaccine antigens that are associated with the surface of FDCs (see Fig. 2.2). B cells process these vaccine antigens into small peptides that they display at their surface through major his- tocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. MHC- peptide complexes thus become available for binding by the specific subset of CD4+ Tfh cells.56,57 These Tfh cells, which express CXCR5, migrate toward CXCL13-expressing FDCs.

Glycoconjugate priming elicits a bona fide GC reaction, with the induction of high- affinity memory B cells that can be rapidly (4–7 days) recalled on PS immunization.122 Efficient priming (i.e., induction of immune memory) is readily demonstrated in children primed in infancy.146,147 However, immune memory can be seen in children with Hib vaccine failure,148 indicating that their res- ervoir of memory B cells did not protect them against invasive disease, perhaps through a failure of avidity maturation.149 The discrepancy between the existence of memory B cells and the lack of protection may again reflect the race against microbial invasion: the time required for production of sufficient levels of circulating antibodies could be too long to interrupt bacte- rial invasion. Notably, secondary vaccine failures have been relatively rare and primarily observed in countries using an early accelerated infant schedule without a booster dose,150 the use of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP)/Hib vaccines with lower Hib immunogenicity is also associated with vaccine failure.151 Similarly, glycoconjugate vaccines against group C meningococcal disease proved much more efficacious during the first year after infant priming than during the following 3 years.141 Thus, infant immunization fails to induce sustained protection against group C meningococcus, despite the induction and persistence of immune memory.152 The requirement for boosters to confer long-term vaccine pro- tection is also well illustrated for pertussis, for which boosters are required to extend protection beyond childhood.153 An interesting observation is that vaccine-induced memory per- sists following pertussis immunization—as illustrated by anamnestic responses to a booster dose—but is not sufficient for protection.

"Live attenuated viral vaccines (measles, rubella) are consid- ered the prototype inducers of lifelong immunity, although prolonged immunity is also induced by certain nonlive vac- cines (hepatitis A, HPV, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, rabies). This derives in part from the induction of sustained antibody responses, which, however, tend to slowly decline in the absence of recurrent exposure,155 and might eventually result in a growing proportion of seronegative vaccinated young adults, including women of childbearing age. Whether the reactivation of immune memory will be sufficient to curtail the replication process and confer protection against measles, rubella, or varicella, and whether adult booster doses may become needed after microbial control, are essential ques- tions. The resurgence of mumps outbreaks in fully vaccinated young adults may reflect the induction of low numbers of memory B cells156 and demonstrates that secondary vaccine failure may occur even with live attenuated vaccines.157 The questions, which are central to sustained vaccine efficacy, are usually unresolved at the time of registration of a new vaccine. For example, to vaccinate young girls against HPV requires reassurance that vaccine protection will extend during several decades. HPV infection of the basal epithelial cells can occur within minutes and is not followed by any antigen exposure to the immune system. Thus, antibody persistence will be required for sustained protection.

The generation of CD4+ Th-cell response begins when DCs capture antigen in peripheral tissue and migrate to draining lymph nodes, where T-cell vaccine responses are elicited in parallel to B-cell responses (see Table 2.1). Thus, DCs fulfill a pivotal role in initiating and shaping the immune response to vaccine antigens.",49,Vaccines,Vaccines – Toxoid,1.0
"Protein vaccine antigens are taken up by immature DCs activated by local inflammation, which provide the signals required for their migration to draining lymph nodes (see Fig. 2.1). During this migration, DCs mature and their surface expression of molecules changes.159 Simultaneously, antigens are processed into small fragments and displayed at the cell surface in the grooves of MHC (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] in humans) molecules. As a rule, MHC class I molecules present peptides from antigens that are produced in the cytosol of infected cells, whereas phagocytosed antigens are essentially displayed on MHC class II molecules.160–163 Thus, mature DCs reaching the T-cell zone of lymph nodes display MHC–peptide complexes and high levels of costimulation molecules at their surface.164 CD4+ T cells recognize antigenic peptides displayed by class II MHC molecules, whereas CD8+ T cells bind to class I MHC-peptide complexes (Fig. 2.6).165 Their recognition is restricted to short peptides (8–11 [CD8+] or 10–18 [CD4+] amino acids) displayed on specific MHC class I or II molecules, respectively.

These T-cell epitopes may be gener- ated from any region of the vaccine antigens, whether the peptide sequence is located within or at the surface of the protein. This is in contrast with B-cell recognition, which is essentially limited to conformational determinants consti- tuted by amino acids at the antigen surface. This MHC-peptide signal (signal 1) is not sufficient for activation of T cells, which remain anergic or become tolerized in absence of costimula- tion (signal 2).

These Tregs may be elicited as feedback mechanisms to avoid excessive and, thus, potentially harmful inflammatory responses.

What Are the Determinants of Vaccine-Induced T-Cell Memory?,27,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunization,1.0
"Effector T-cell responses are short-lived, and most (>90%) effector T cells die by apoptosis within a few days. Thus, immune memory is essential to T-cell vaccine efficacy. It is dependent on four main parameters: the frequency of antigen- specific memory T cells, their phenotype, their persistence, and their localization, a recently identified parameter (Table 2.9).174,180,181 Memory T cells may persist lifelong, even in the absence of antigen exposure and despite their quality and amount being set during the primary immune response.",27,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunization,1.0
"The frequency of memory T cells directly reflects the mag- nitude of the initial T-cell expansion and that of its subsequent contraction during which few surviving cells differentiate toward memory T cells. The main determinant of the expan- sion phase is the level of or duration of antigen stimulation present during priming.182 This is a major limitation for non- replicating vaccines, which fail to reach sufficient antigen content and typically require the presence of an adjuvant and/ or booster doses. The contraction phase and the transition toward memory cells take place soon after antigen is cleared, which occurs faster for nonreplicating vaccines. Current efforts are, thus, oriented toward the optimization of the primary expansion phase through adjuvants and/or booster adminis- tration. As vaccine-induced immunity limits the subsequent “take” of a live vaccine by inducing its rapid neutralization, one attractive approach is the use of distinct vaccines for priming and boosting, as the adenovirus priming–modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) boosting combination currently considered against Ebola virus.183–186",3,Vaccines,Vaccines – Tetanus,1.0
The phenotype of memory T cells is also important. Two,9,Cells,Cells – Memoryt,1.0

Their role is to recognize antigens transported by activated DCs into lymph nodes and to rapidly undergo massive proliferation and differentiation, generating a delayed but very large wave of effector cells.188 Effector memory T cells (Tem), closer in phe- notype to recently activated T cells, have a high cytotoxic potential that enables them to immediately recognize the pathogen. As they essentially lack lymph nodes homing recep- tors, it was proposed that Tem recirculate from the blood through nonlymphoid organs, monitoring tissues for the pres- ence of specific microbial peptides.188 A third type of memory",31,Peptides,Peptides,1.0

The long-term persistence of memory T cells is well established. Through homeostatic proliferation, memory T cells may persist lifelong, even without antigen exposure.180,181,191 Studies of the persistence of vaccinia-induced immune memory have confirmed this observation in humans.192–194",27,Vaccine,Vaccine – Immunization,1.0

"As B cells recognize conformational epitopes constituted by distant amino acids, they may bind to antigenic peptides with distinct sequences: It has been estimated that roughly 5% of monoclonal antibodies made against 15 viruses cross- reacted with human proteins.197 That any viral infection is not followed by the induction or flare of an autoimmune disease highlights the importance of regulatory mechanisms suppress- ing responses directed against self-antigens. Indeed, the specificity of antibody responses is well controlled. Although polyclonal stimulation has been suggested to activate memory B cells of distinct specificities,137 this response is not associated with antibody responses. Vaccination with tetanus toxoid was found to expand specific and bystander memory T cells but did not modulate antibody responses to unrelated antigens.198 Altogether, this indicates that the induction of cross-reactive antibody responses is extremely limited, which may be impor- tant in preventing undesirable reactions, but which limits the efficacy of vaccine-induced antibody responses to very few cross-reacting nonvaccine serotypes.199",-1,Noise / Outlier,Noise / Outlier,0.0

"Early life antibody responses are directly determined by the prenatal (e.g., gestational age238) and the postnatal age at immunization.236 Accelerated infant vaccine schedules in which three vaccine doses are given at 1-month intervals (2, 3, 4 or 3, 4, 5 months) result in lower immune responses than schedules in which more time elapses between doses (2, 4, 6 months) or between the priming and boosting dose (3, 5, 12 months). However, the magnitude of infant antibody responses to multiple dose schedules reflects the interval between doses, with longer intervals eliciting stronger responses, and the age at which the last vaccine dose is admin- istered.

However, the higher titers of maternal antibodies elicited by maternal immunization eventually interfere, even with responses to acellular pertussis vaccines.275,282",12,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antibodies,0.5836656701136439
"Maternal antibodies usually allow a certain degree of priming (i.e., of induction of memory B cells) through yet undefined mechanisms. As a rule, the blunting of infant antibody responses by maternal antibodies disappears after boosting. Importantly, maternal antibodies do not exert their inhibitory influence on infant T-cell responses, which remain largely unaffected or even enhanced.283–285 This is best explained by the fate of maternal antibody–vaccine antigen complexes: immune complexes are taken up by macrophages and DCs, dissociate into their acidic phagolysosome compart- ment, and are processed into small peptides. These peptides are displayed at the surface of APCs and are available for binding by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.",26,Antibodies,Antibodies,0.15672398333641754
"Thus, the main challenge for further improvement of early life immunization strategies are to identify vaccine formula- tions and strategies capable of inducing, after one or two early doses, the strong primary antibody responses required against certain early life pathogens—despite the presence of maternal antibodies. Importantly, these formulations/strategies will have to be demonstrated as safe in immunologically immature hosts, adding to the challenges.286",10,Vaccines,Vaccines – Antigens,1.0

"responses decline with age, which increases the frequency and severity of infections and reduces the protective effects of vaccinations.287 Aging affects the magnitude and the persistence of antibody responses to protein vaccines,288,289 as reflected by lower serum antibodies to influenza,290,291 tetanus, and tick- borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccines.292 It also affects responses to pneumococcal PS vaccines, although differences in method- ological issues have yielded contradictory results.293 Remark- ably, the limitation of antibody responses by aging occurs early: After the age of 20 years, each 10-year period reduced antibody titers elicited by a potent adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine in healthy control subjects and immunosuppressed patients by 31%.294 Limitations of antibody responses in elderly people are also associated with qualitative changes that affect antibody specificity, isotype, and affinity, that is, functional efficacy (see Table 2.10).295,296",34,Vaccination,Vaccination,0.5438500702021394

"lying events.232,297 Responses to PS vaccines are conditioned by a decline in the reservoir of IgM+ memory B cells that differ- entiate less efficiently into antibody producing cells, and, thus, limit the IgM responses of aged people.298 Antibody responses relying on the induction of GCs are also limited,299 affecting the magnitude of antibody responses and resulting into anti- bodies of weaker affinities/functional capacities296 and distri- bution of subclass antibodies.300 Numerous factors contribute to limiting the induction of GCs in elderly persons, including factors that are intrinsic to B cells301 and that affect other cell types, including Tfh cells.302 For example, studies in aged mice have convincingly demonstrated the existence of age-related changes in FDCs.303,304 The limited ability of aged subjects to generate high-affinity antibody responses also reflects changes in their antibody repertoire.304,305",30,Antibody,Antibody – Vaccine,0.7833297333635564

"a progressive decline in naïve T cells, reflecting declining thymic output. This is associated with a marked accumulation of large CD8+ clones presumably resulting from prior infec- tions. These large T-cell clones (e.g., elicited in response to cytomegalovirus) have reached a state of replicative senes- cence, and homeostatic mechanisms negatively influence the size of the naïve and effector memory T-cell subsets.289 In response to influenza immunization, healthy elderly people mount CD4+ responses initially similar to those of young adults but that fail to maintain or expand.306 This does not reflect a functional impairment of CD4+ T memory cells,307 but a shift of the T-cell pool from naïve to memory effector CD4+ T cells. The failure to maintain CD4+ responses reflects a lower induction of new Tem cells in relation to lower IL-7 levels.306,307 Other studies indicated that frail elderly subjects mount blunted and delayed Th1 responses to influenza vaccination, which correlated positively with their reduced total and IgG1 antibody response.308 Limitations also affect the expansion of infection-driven influenza-specific CD8+ T cells.308 Strategies to enhance vaccine-induced protection in aging people include the use of higher vaccine doses309 and/or specific adjuvants. This was recently demonstrated by formulating the IgE glyco- protein of varicella-zoster in the novel AS01E adjuvant.24 Nev- ertheless, limitations of effector memory and of GC responses may continue to require the more frequent administration of certain vaccine boosters (e.g., against tetanus or TBE308) to compensate for the brevity of B- and T-cell vaccine-induced responses in elderly people.",25,Cells,Cells – Influenza,1.0
